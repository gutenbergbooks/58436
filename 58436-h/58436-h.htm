<p>
Roger Naldrett, the writer, sat in his box
with a friend, watching the second act of his
tragedy.  The first act had been received
coldly; the cast was nervous, and the house, critical as
a first-night audience always is, had begun to fidget.
He watched his failure without much emotion.  He had
lived through his excitement in the days before the
production; but the moment interested him, it was so
unreal.  The play was not like the play which he had
watched so often in rehearsal.  Unless some speech
jarred upon him, as failing to help the action, he found
that he could not judge of it in detail.  In the manuscript,
and in the rehearsals, he had tested it only in detail.
Now he saw it as a whole, as something new, as
a rough and strong idea, of which he could make
nothing.  Shut up there in the box, away from the emotions
of the house, he felt himself removed from time, the
only person in the theatre under no compulsion to
attend.  He sat far back in the box, so that his friend,
John O'Neill, might have a better view of the stage.
He was conscious of the blackness of John's head against
the stage lights, and of a gleam of gilt on the opposite
boxes.  Sometimes when, at irregular intervals, he saw
some of the cast, on the far left of the stage, he felt
disgust at the crudity of the grease paint smeared on their
faces.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes an actor hesitated for his lines, forgot a
few words, or improvised others.  He drew in his
breath sharply, whenever this happened, it was like a
false note in music; but he knew that he was the only
person there who felt the discord.  He found himself
admiring the address of these actors; they had nerve;
they carried on the play, though their memories were a
whirl of old tags all jumbled together.  It was when
there was a pause in the action, through delay at an
entrance, that the harrow drove over his soul; for in the
silence, at the end of it, when those who wanted to
cough had coughed, there sometimes came a single
half-hearted clap, more damning than a hiss.  At those times
he longed to be on the stage crying out to the actors how
much he admired them.  He was shut up in his box,
under cover, but they were facing the music.  They
were playing to a cold wall of shirt-fronts, not yet
hostile, but puzzled by the new mind, and vexed by it.
They might rouse pointed indifference in the shirt-fronts,
they might rouse fury, they would certainly win
no praise.  Roger felt pity for them.  He wished that
the end would come swiftly, that he might be decently
damned and allowed to go.
</p>

<p>
Towards the middle of the act the leading lady made
a pitiful brave effort to save the play.  She played with
her whole strength, in a way which made his spirit rise
up to bless her.  Her effort kept the house for a
moment.  That dim array of heads and shirt-fronts became
polite, attentive; a little glimmer of a thrill began to
pass from the stalls over the house, as the communicable
magic grew stronger.  Then the second lady, who, as
Roger knew, had been feverish at the dress rehearsal,
struggled for a moment with a sore throat which made
the performance torture to her.  Roger heard her voice
break, knowing very well what it meant.  He longed to
cry out to comfort her; though the only words which
came to his heart were: "You poor little devil."  Then
a man in the gallery shouted to her to "Speak up,
please."  Half a dozen others took up the cry.  They
wreaked on the poor woman's misfortune all the venom
which they felt against the play.  Craning far forward,
the author saw the second lady bite her lip with
chagrin; but she spoke up like a heroine.  After that the
spell lost hold.  The act dragged on, people coughed
and fidgeted; the play seemed to grow in absurd
unreality, till Roger wondered why there was no hissing.
The actors, who had been hitherto too slow, began to
hurry.  They rushed through an instant of dramatic
interest, which, with a good audience, would have gone
solemnly.  The climax came with a rush, the act ended,
the last speech was spoken.  Then, for five, ten, fifteen,
twenty fearful seconds the curtain hesitated.  The
absurd actors stood absurdly waiting for the heavy red
cloth to cloak them from the house.  Something had
jammed, or the flyman had missed his cue.  When the
curtain fell half the house was sniggering.  The
half-dozen derisive claps which followed were intended for
the flyman.
</p>

<p>
The author's box happened to be the royal box, with
a sitting-room beyond it, furnished principally with
chairs and ash-trays.  When the lights brightened,
Roger walked swiftly into the sitting-room and lighted
a cigarette.  John O'Neill came stumbling after him.
</p>

<p>
"It's very good.  It's very good," he said with
vehemence.  "It's all I thought it when you read it.  The
audience don't know what to make of it.  They're
puzzled by the new mind.  It's the finest thing that's been
done here since poor Wentworth's thing."  He paused
for a second, then looked at Roger with a hard, shrewd,
medical look.  "I don't quite like the look of your
leading lady.  She's going to break down."
</p>

<p>
"They'll never stand the third act," said Roger.
"There'll be a row in the third act."
</p>

<p>
At this moment the door opened.  Falempin, the
manager of the theatre, a gross and cheerful gentleman,
with the relics of a boisterous vinous beauty in his face,
entered with a mock bow.
</p>

<p>
"Naldrett," he said, with a strong French accent,
"you are all right.  Your play is very fine.  Very
interesting.  I go to lose four thousan' poun' over your
play.  Eh?  Very good.  What so?  Som' day I go
to make forty thousan' poun' out of your play.  Eh?
It is all in a day's work.  The peegs" (he meant his
patrons, the audience) "will not stan' your third act.
It is too&mdash;it is too&mdash;"  He shook his head over the
third act.  "Miss Hanlon, pretty little Miss Hanlon,
she go into hysterics."
</p>

<p>
"Could I go round to speak to her?" Roger asked.
</p>

<p>
"No good," said Falempin.  "She cannot see any
one.  She will not interrupt her illusion."
</p>

<p>
"What happened to the curtain?" O'Neill asked.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, the curtain.  It was absurd.  I go to see about
the curtain.  We meet at Philippi.  Eh?  There will
be a row.  But you are all right, Naldrett.  You know
John O'Neill.  Eh?  Mr. O'Neill he tell you you are
all right."  He bowed with a flourish of gloved hands,
and vanished through the stage door.
</p>

<p>
"John," said Roger, "the play's killed.  I don't
mind about the play; but I want to know what it is that
they hate."
</p>

<p>
"They hate the new mind," said Roger.  "They've
been accustomed to folly, persiflage, that abortion the
masculine hero, and justifications of their vices.  They
like caricatures of themselves.  They like photographs.
They like illuminated texts.  They decorate their
minds just as they do their homes.  You come to them
out of the desert, all locusts and wild honey, crying out
about beauty.  These people won't stand it.  They are
the people in Frith's Derby Day.  Worse.  They think
they aren't."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry about Falempin," said Roger.  "He's a
good fellow.  I shall lose him a lot of money."
</p>

<p>
"Falempin's a Frenchman.  He would rather produce
a work of art than pass his days, as he calls it,
selling 'wash for the peegs.'  What is four thousand to
a theatre manager?  A quarter's rent.  And what is
a quarter's rent to anybody?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Roger, "it's a good deal to me.  Let's
go round the house and hear what they say."
</p>

<p>
They thrust their cigarettes into ash-trays, and passed
through the stalls to the foyer.  The foyer of the King's
was large.  The decorations of mirrors, gilt, marble, and
red velvet, gave it that look of the hotel which art's
temples seldom lack in this country.  It is a concession
to the taste of the patrons; you see it in theatres and
in picture galleries, wherever vulgarity has her
looking-glasses.  There were many people gathered there.
Half a dozen minor critics stood together comparing
notes, deciding, as outsiders think, what it would be
safe to say.  Roger noticed among them a short, burly,
shaggy-haired man, who wore a turned-down collar.
He did not know the man; but he knew at once, from
his appearance, that he was a critic, and a person of no
distinction.  He was about to look elsewhere, when he
saw, with a flush of anger, that the little burly man had
paused in his speech, with his cigarette dropped from
his mouth, to watch them narrowly, in the covert
manner of the ill-bred and malignant.  Roger saw him give
a faint nudge with his elbow to the man nearest to him.
The man turned to look; three of the others turned to
look; the little man's lips moved in a muttered
explanation.  The group stared.  Roger, who resented their
impertinence, stared back so pointedly that their eyes
fell.  O'Neill's hands twitched.  Roger became
conscious that this was one of O'Neill's feuds.  They
walked together past the group, with indifferent faces.
As they passed, the little man, still staring, remarked,
"One of that school."  They heard his feet move round
so that he might stare after them.  O'Neill turned to
Roger.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know who that is?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"That's O'Donnell, of <i>The Box Office</i>.  He's the
man who did for poor Wentworth's thing.  I called
him out in Paris.  He wouldn't come."
</p>

<p>
"Really, John?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you're too young; you don't remember.  He
wrote everywhere.  He wrote a vile tract called <i>Drama
and Decency</i>.  He nearly got Wentworth prosecuted."
</p>

<p>
"I've heard of that!  So O'Donnell wrote that?"
</p>

<p>
"He did."
</p>

<p>
"Who are the others?"
</p>

<p>
"Obscure dailies and illustrateds."
</p>

<p>
A little grey man, with nervous eyes, came up to
Roger, claiming acquaintance on the strength of one
previous meeting.  He began to talk to Roger with the
easy patronage of one who, though impotent in art himself,
and without a divine idea in him, has the taste of
his society, its gossip, its critical cant, and an
acquaintance with some of its minor bards.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't be discouraged," he said, with implied
intellectual superiority; "I hear you have quite a little
following.  How do you like the acting?  I don't like
Miss Hanlon's acting myself.  Did you choose her?"  As
he spoke his eyes wandered over O'Neill, who stood
apart, with his back half turned to them.  It was
evident that he knew O'Neill by sight, and wished to be
introduced to him.  Roger remembered how this man had
called O'Neill a charlatan.  An insult rose to his lips.
Who was this fumbling little City man, with his Surrey
villa and collection of Meryon etchings, to patronise,
and condemn, and to bid him not to be discouraged?
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said coldly.  "I wrote the play for her.
She's the only tragic actress you've had here since Miss
Cushman."
</p>

<p>
The little City man smiled, apparently by elongating
his eyes.  He laid up, for a future dinner table, a
condemnation of this young dramatist, as too
"opinionated," too "crude."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" he answered.  "By the way&mdash;my daughter
is here; she wants so much to talk to you about the
play.  Will you come?"
</p>

<p>
Roger had met this daughter once before.  He saw
her now, an anæmic girl, in a Liberty dress, standing
with her nose in the air, amid a mob of first-nighters.
She, too, wished to patronise him and to criticise the
oracle.  The superiority of a girl of nineteen was more
than he could stand.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," he said.  "Afterwards, perhaps.  I must
be off now with my friend."
</p>

<p>
He gave a hurried nod, caught O'Neill's arm, and
fled.  Two men collided in his path and exchanged
criticism with each other.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, old man," said one; "what do you think of it?"
</p>

<p>
"I call it a German farce."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; rather colourless.  It opened well."
</p>

<p>
Further on, a tall, pale, fat woman, with a flagging
jowl, talked loudly to two lesser women.
</p>

<p>
"I call it simply disgusting.  I wonder such a piece
should be allowed."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't mind its being disgusting so much," said
one of her friends; "but what I can't stand is that it is
so uninteresting.  There's no meaning.  It doesn't
mean anything.  It has no criticism of life."
</p>

<p>
"They say he's killing himself with chloral," said the
third woman.
</p>

<p>
At the entrance to the smoke-room, they were stopped
by the crowd.  A lady with fine eyes fanned herself
vigorously on the arm of her escort.
</p>

<p>
"It's very interestin'," she said; "but, of course, it
isn't a play."
</p>

<p>
"No.  It's not a play," said her friend.  After a
pause, he defined his critical position.  "Y'know, I
don't believe in all this talk about Ibsen and that.  I
like a play to be a play."
</p>

<p>
The smoke-room was full of men with cigarettes.
Nearly all had a look of the theatre about them,
something clean-shaven, something in the eye, in the fatness
of the lower jaw, and in the general exaggeration of the
bearing.  Something loud and unreal.  The pretty
girls at the bar were busy, expending the same smile,
and the same charm of manner, on each customer, and
dismissing him, when served, with an indifference which
was like erasure.  The friends lighted fresh cigarettes
and shared a bottle of Perrier water.  The pretty,
weary-faced waitress looked at Roger intently, with
interested sympathy.  She had seen the dress-rehearsal,
she was one of his admirers.
</p>

<p>
Matches scratched and spluttered; soda-water bubbled
into spirits; the cork extractors squeaked and
thumped, with a noise of fizzing.  A pale, white-haired
man, with an amber cigarette-holder nine inches long,
evidently his only claim to distinction, held a glass at
an angle, dispensing criticism.
</p>

<p>
"It's all damned tommy-rot," he said.  "All this
tosh these young fellers write.  It's what I call German
measles.  Now we've got a drama.  You may say what
you like about these Scandinavian people, and
Hauptmann, and what's the name of the French feller, who
wrote the book about wasps?  They're all.  You know
what I mean.  Every one of them.  Like the
pre-Raphaelites were; but put them beside our English
dramatists; where are they?"
</p>

<p>
Some one with an Irish voice maintained in a lull,
rather brilliantly, that Shakespeare had no intellect,
but that Coriolanus showed a genuine feeling for the
stage.
</p>

<p>
A friend without definite contradiction offered, in
amendment, that: "None of the Elizabethans were any
good at all; Coriolanus was a Latin exercise.  English
drama dated from 1893."
</p>

<p>
A third put in a word for Romeo and Juliet.  "Of
course, in all his serious work, Shakespeare is a most
irritating writer.  But in Romeo and Juliet he is less
irritating than usual.  I like the Tomb scene."
</p>

<p>
The Irish voice replied that the English had the
ballad instinct, and liked those stories which would be
tolerable in a ballad; but that intellectual eminence
was shown by form, not by an emotional condition.
This led to the obvious English retort that form was
nothing, as long as the thought was all right; and that
anyway our construction was better than the French.
The talk closed in on the discussion, shutting it out with
babble; nothing more was heard.
</p>

<p>
The two friends, sipping Perrier water, were sensible
of hostility in the house, without hearing definite
charges.  An electric bell whirred overhead.  Glasses
were hurriedly put down; cigarettes were dropped into
the pots of evergreens.  The tide set back towards the
stalls.  As they paused to let a lady precede them down
a gangway, they heard her pass judgment to a friend.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, it may be very clever; but what I mean
is that it's not amusing.  It's not like a play."
</p>

<p>
A clear feminine voice dropped a final shot in a hush.
"Oh, I think it's tremendously second-rate; like all his
books.  I think he must be a most intolerable young
man.  I know some friends of his."
</p>

<p>
Wondering which friends they were, Roger Naldrett
took his seat in his box an instant before the curtain
rose.
</p>

<p>
Four minutes later, when the house found that the
cap fitted, a line was hissed loudly.  It passed, the
actors rallied, Miss Hanlon's acting gathered intensity.
As the emotional crisis of the act approached, she
seemed to be taking hold of the audience.  The beauty
of the play even moved the author a little.  Then, at her
finest moment, in a pause, the prelude to her great
appeal, a coarse female voice, without natural beauty, and
impeded rather than helped, artificially, by a segment
of apple newly-bitten, called ironically, "Ow, chyce
me," from somewhere far above.  The temper of the
house as a whole was probably against the voice; but
collective attention is fickle.  There was a second of
hesitation, during which, though the play went on, the
audience wondered whether they should laugh, following
the titterers, or say "Sh" vigorously in opposition
to them.  A big man in the stalls decided them, by
letting his mirth, decently checked during the instant,
explode, much as an expanded bladder will explode when
smitten with a blunt instrument.
</p>

<p>
"Ow, Charlie!" cried the voice again.  Everybody
laughed.  The big man, confirmed in what had at first
alarmed him, roared like a bull.  When the laughter
ended, the play was lost.  No acting in the world could
have saved it.
</p>

<p>
For a moment it went on; but the wits had been
encouraged by their success.  A few mild young men,
greatly daring, bashfully addressed questions to the
stage in self-conscious voices.  Whistles sounded
suddenly in shrill bursts.  Somebody hissed in the stalls.
A line reflecting on England's foreign policy, or seeming
to do so, for there is nothing topical in good literature,
raised shouts of "Yah," and "Pro-Boer," phrases
still shouted at advanced thinkers in moments of
popular pride.  At the most poignant moment of the tragedy
the gallery shouted "Boo" in sheer anger.  The stalls,
excited by the noise, looked round, and up, smiling.
Songsters began one of the vile songs of the music-halls,
debased in its words, its rhythms, and its tune.  Their
feet beat time to it.  The booing made a monotony as
of tom-toms; whistles and cat-calls sounded, like
wild-birds flying across the darkness.  People got up
blunderingly to leave the theatre, treading on other
people's toes, stumbling over their knees, with oaths in
their hearts, and apologies on their lips.  The play had
come to an end.  The cast waited for the noise to cease.
Miss Hanlon, the sword at her throat, stood self-possessed,
ready with her line and gesture, only waiting for
quiet.  Two of the actors talked to each other, looking
straight across the stage at the dim mob before them.
Roger could see their lips move.  He imagined the
cynical slangy talk passing between them.  He recognised
Miss Hanlon's sister standing in one of the boxes
on the other side.
</p>

<p>
The noise grew louder.  John O'Neill, leaving his
seat, came over to him and shouted in his ear.
"You're having a fine row," he shouted.
</p>

<p>
Roger nodded back to John in the darkness.  "Yes,
yes," he said.  He was wondering why he didn't care
more deeply at this wreck of his work.  He did not
care.  The yelling mob disgusted him; but not more
than any other yelling mob.  He wished that it had
but one face, so that he might spit in it, and smite it,
to avenge brave Miss Hanlon, the genius cried down
by the rabble, who still waited, with the sobs choking
her.  Otherwise, he did not care two straws.  He
believed in his work.  Beauty was worth following
whatever the dull ass thought.  He sat on the edge of the
box, and stared down at his enemies, "the peegs."  A
rowdy in the stalls, drawing a bow at a venture, shouted
"Author."  At that instant the curtain came down, and
the lights went up.  "Author," the house shouted.
"Yah.  Author.  Boo."  Women paused in the putting
on of their opera-cloaks to level glasses at him.
He saw a dozen such.  He saw the men staring.  He
heard one man, one solitary friend, who strove to clap,
abruptly told to "chuck it."  "Author," came the
shout.  "Yah.  Boo.  Author.  Gow 'owm."
</p>

<p>
He stood up to look at his enemies.  One man, a
critic, was clapping him, an act of courage in such a
house.  The rest were enjoying the row, or helping it,
or hurriedly leaving with timid women.  Those who
jeered, jeered mostly at John O'Neill, who looked liker
an author than his friend (i.e. his hair was longer).
</p>

<p>
"This is nearly martyrdom," said John.  "Your
work must be better than I thought."
</p>

<p>
Roger laughed.  The people, seeing the laughter,
yelled in frenzy.  Falempin came from behind the curtain.
He looked at the house indifferently, stroking his
white beard, as though debating over a supper menu.
He glanced absently at his watch, and tapped in a
bored manner with his foot.  He was trying to decide
whether he should insult the "peegs," and gloriously
end his career as a theatre manager.  Fear lest they
should misunderstand his insult, and perhaps take it
as a compliment, restrained him in the end, even more
than the thought of what his wife would say.  He
waited for a lull in the uproar to remark coolly that the
play would not go on.  After a pause, he told the
orchestra to play "God save the King" with excessive
fervour, for a long time; which they did, grinning.  A
few policemen in the pit and gallery directed the
religious spirit, thus roused, into peaceful works.  The
hooters began to pass out of the theatre, laughing and
yelling; three or four young men, linking arms, stood
across an exit, barring the passage to women.  One of
them, being struck in the face, showed fight, and was
violently flung forth.  The others, aiding their leader,
fought all down the stairs from the gallery, hindered by
the escaping crowd.  They suffered in the passage.
One of them, with his collar torn off, scuffled on the
sidewalk, crying out that he wanted his "'at."  He
wasn't going without his "'at."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, in the pit, a dozen stalwarts stood by
the stalls barrier, waiting to boo the author as he left
his box.  The stalls were fast emptying.  Two attendants,
still carrying programmes, halted under Roger's
box to say that it was a "shyme."  Roger, at the
moment, was writing hurriedly on a programme a rough
draft of a note of thanks, praise, and sympathy to Miss
Hanlon.  It was only when he came to use his faculties
that he found them scattered by the agitations of the
night.  The words which rose up in his mind were like
words used in dreams; they seemed to be meaningless.
He botched together a crudity after a long beating of his
brains; but the result, when written out on a sheet of
notepaper, found in the ante-room, was feeble enough.
</p>

<p>
He twisted the paper swiftly into a tricorne.  "Come
along, John," he said.  "We'll go through the stage;
I must leave this for Miss Hanlon."
</p>

<p>
They passed through the ante-room into a chamber
heaped with properties, and thence, by a swift turn, on
to the stage, where a few hands were shifting the scenery
and talking of the row.  On the draughty, zig-zag,
concrete stairs, leading to the dressing-rooms, the
stage-manager stood talking to a minor actor under a
wavering gas-jet enclosed by a wire mesh.
</p>

<p>
"Quite a little trouble, sir," he said to Naldrett.
"Too bad."
</p>

<p>
"They didn't seem to like it, did they?  Which is
Miss Hanlon's room?"
</p>

<p>
"In number three, sir; but there's her dresser, if
you've a note for her, sir.  There's some ladies with
her."
</p>

<p>
Outside the stage door, in the alley leading to the
street, several idlers waited idly for an opportunity for
outrage.  In the street itself a crowd had gathered at
the theatre entrance.  A mob of vacant faces stood
under the light, staring at the doors.  They stared
without noise and without intelligence, under the spell
of that mesmerism which binds common intellects so
easily.  Policemen moved through the mob, moving
little parts of it, more by example than by precept.
The starers moved because others moved.  In the road
was a glare of cab lights.  Light gleamed on harness,
on the satin of cloaks, on the hats of footmen.
</p>

<p>
"When did the age of polish begin?" said Roger.
</p>

<p>
"When the age of gilt ended," said John.  "It's a
base age; you can't even be a decent corpse without
polish on your coffin.  Here we are at the Masquers;
shall we sup here, or at the Petits Soupers?"
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  What, do we nod?  Sound music, and let us startle our spirits...<br />
  Ay, this has waked us.  <i>The Poetaster</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The act of sitting to table changed John's mood.
The lightness and gaiety passed from him.
It seemed to Roger that he grew visibly very
old and haggard, as the merry mood, stimulated by the
excitement of the theatre, faded away.  At times,
during supper, John gave his friend the impression that
the spiritual John was on a journey, or withdrawn into
another world.  He spoke little, chiefly in monosyllables,
making no allusion to the play.  He was become
a shell, almost an unreal person.  He gave no
sign of possessing that intellectual energy which made
his talk so attractive to young men interested in the
arts.  Roger's fancy suggested that John was a kind of
John the Baptist, a torch-bearer, sent to set other
people on fire, but without real fire of his own.  He felt
that John had lighted an entire city, by some obscure
heap of shavings in a suburb, and had now dashed out
his torch, so that the night hid him.  He realised how
little he knew this man, intimate as they had been.
</p>

<p>
Nobody knew him.  Nobody knew what he was.
There were some who held that John was the Wandering
Jew, others that he was a Nihilist, a Carlist, a
Balmacedist, a Jacobite, the heir to France, King
Arthur, anti-Christ, or Parnell.  All had felt the
mystery, but none had solved it.  Here was this strange,
enigmatic, brilliant man, an influence in art, in many
arts, though he practised none with supreme devotion.
He had wandered over most of the world; he spoke
many tongues; he had friends in strange Asian cities,
in Western mining towns, in rubber camps, in ships, in
senates.  No one had ever received a letter from him.
But his rooms were always thronged with outlandish
guests from all parts of the world.  Looking at him
across the table, Roger felt small suddenly, as though
John really were a spirit now suddenly lapsing back
into the night, after a spectral moment of glowing.  He
felt the man's extraordinary personality, and his own
terrible pettiness in apprehending so little of it.
Something was wrong with him, something was the matter
with the night.  Or had the whole unreal evening been
a dream?  Or were they all dead, and was this heaven
or hell? for life seemed charged with all manner of
new realities.  He had never felt like this before.
Something was changing in his brain.  He was realising
his own spiritual advances, in one of those rare
moments in which one apprehends truth.  It occurred
to him, with a sudden impulse to violent laughter, that
John, sitting back in his chair, mesmerised by the
fantasy of the smoke from his cigarette, was also in a mood
of spiritual crisis, attaining long-desired peace.
</p>

<p>
John watched his cigarette till the ash fell, when the
truth seemed fully attained, the soul's step upward made
good.  He glanced up at Roger like a man just waking
from a dream, like a man, long puzzled, at last made
certain.
</p>

<p>
"What are your plans?" he asked suddenly.
"You'll go on writing?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I shall go on writing," Roger answered.
He was puzzled by the abruptness and detachment of
John's manner.  "I've got that Louis Quatorze play
finished.  I shall start on another in a day or two.
I've a novel half finished; I told you the fable, I
think.  I've not done much since the rehearsals began."
</p>

<p>
"You'll have a great success some day," said John,
half to himself.  "You'll be all that Wentworth
might have been had he lived.  You know Wentworth's
work?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Roger said.  The question surprised him.
John was speaking to him as though he were a stranger.
They had discussed Wentworth's work a score of times.
"What sort of man was he?" he added.
</p>

<p>
"A great genius in himself.  In his work I don't
think he was that, though of course he did wonderful
things.  You told me once that you were in love.  How
does that go on?"
</p>

<p>
"I see her sometimes.  I can't ask her to marry me.
My prospects&mdash;well&mdash;I live by writing."
</p>

<p>
"She is rich, I think you said?  She lives in Ireland?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Love is the devil!" said John abruptly.  "I'm
going abroad to-morrow, on account of my lungs.  I
was wondering if I should see you settled before I
left."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!  You never told me."
</p>

<p>
"Wentworth used to say that, socially, the body does
not exist.  I thought of telling you.  But there, there
were other reasons.  Things which I can't tell you
about."
</p>

<p>
"But where are you going?"
</p>

<p>
"To a place in South Spain.  I can't tell you more.
Listen.  I believe that I am on the verge of discovering
a great secret.  It is an amazing thing; I've been
working at it with Centeno, that young Spaniard who comes
to my rooms.  I am going to Spain so that I may work
with him in a warm climate."
</p>

<p>
He rose from his seat excited by the thought of the
discovery.  He gulped the last of his wine, as though
in a sudden fever to be at work.  He flung on hat and
coat in the same feverish preoccupation.
</p>

<p>
Roger, who had seen him thus before, knew that he
was forgotten.  His friend was already in those secret
rooms at the top of a house in Queen Square.  His
spirit was there, bowed over the work with the Spanish
scholar; the earthly part of him was a parcel left
behind in a restaurant to follow as it might.  Words from
nowhere floated into Roger's mind.  It was as though
some of John's attendant spirits had whispered to him:
"Your friend is busy with some strange doctrine of the
soul," said the whisperer.  "This world does not exist
for him.  You are nothing to him; you are only a little
part of the eternal, dragging a caddis-worm's house
of greeds.  He is set free."
</p>

<p>
He looked up quickly to see John deep in thought,
with a waiter, standing beside him, offering an unnoticed
bill.  Roger paid the bill.  In another minute they
were standing in the glare of the Circus, amid tumult
and harsh light.  Something in the unrhythmical riot
broke the dreamer's mood.  He looked at Roger
absently, as though remembering an event in a past life.
A fit of coughing shook him, and left him trembling.
</p>

<p>
"Your play is a fine thing," he said weakly, as he
hailed a hansom.  "You are all right.  I can't ask you
to come round to my rooms; for I am working there
with Centeno.  I work there far into the night, and I
am in rather a mess with packing to-night."
</p>

<p>
He seemed to pass into his reverie again; for he did
not notice Roger's hand.  He was muttering to himself,
"This is an unreal world; this is an unreal world,"
between gulps of cigarette smoke.  A sudden burst of
energy made him enter the cab.  Roger gave the
cab-man the address, and closed the cab's aprons.  His
friend lifted a hand languidly and sank back into the
gloom.  The last that Roger saw of him was a white,
immobile mask of a face, rising up from the black
pointed beard, which looked so like the beard of an
Assyrian king.  The cab was hidden from sight among
a medley of vehicles before Roger realised that his
friend was gone.
</p>

<p>
It struck Roger then that the evening had brought
him very near to romance.  He had seen his soul's work
shouted down, by the minotaur.  Now the man whom
he had worshipped was going away to die.  More than
the pain of losing the friend was the sharpness of
jealousy; for why could not he, instead of Centeno, help
that spirit in the last transmutation, in the last glory,
when the cracking brain cell let in heaven?  He felt
himself judged, and set aside.  For an instant an
impulse moved him to creep in upon the secret, up the
stairs, through the corridor piled with books, to the
dark room, hung with green, where the work went
forward.  He longed to surprise those conspirators over
their secret of the soul, and to be initiated into the
mystery, even at the sword's point.  He put this thought
from him; but the shock of John's parting brought it
back again.  His spirit seemed to flounder in him.
He felt stunned and staggered.
</p>

<p>
He crossed Shaftesbury Avenue wondering how life
was to go on with no O'Neill.  He had no thought for
his play's failure; this sorrow filled his nature.  He
paused for an instant on the western sidewalk of the
avenue so that he might light a cigarette.  As he bent
over the flame, some one struck him violently between
the shoulders.  He turned swiftly, full of anger, to
confront a half-drunken man whose face had the peculiar
bloated shapelessness of the London sot.  The man
unjustly claimed, with many filthy words, that Roger had
jostled against him, and that he was going to&mdash;well,
show him different.  A little crowd gathered, expecting
a fight.  When the man's language was at its filthiest,
a policeman interfered, bidding the drunkard go
home quietly.  The man asked how any one could go
home quietly with &mdash;&mdash; toffs running into him.  The
policeman turned to Roger.
</p>

<p>
Roger was sickened and disgusted.  Charging the
man, and causing him to be imprisoned or fined, was
not to be thought of.  The man was not sober; he
had passed into a momentary fury of passion, and had
butted blindly like an enraged bull.  The mistake, and
the foul talk, and the sudden attentions of the crowd at
such a moment when he hoped to be alone, gave Roger
a feeling of helpless hatred of himself and of modern
life.  He turned abruptly.  His enemy dogged him for
a few steps, dropping filthy names, one by one, while
some of the crowd followed, hoping that there would be
an assault.  The pursuit ended with a snarl.  The
drunkard turned diagonally across the street, so nearly
under two motor-cabs that the crowd lost interest in
Roger from that instant.
</p>

<p>
Roger remembered that a few yards away there was
a German restaurant, where some of his friends used to
play dominoes over steins of lager.  He entered the
restaurant, hoping to meet some one; hoping, too, that
the kindly foreign feeling which made the place restful
and delightful might help him to forget his sorrow and
distaste for life.  He ordered coffee and cognac, and sat
there, sorrowfully smoking, scanning those who entered,
but seeing no friend among them.
</p>

<p>
As he smoked the memories of the evening assailed
him.  He saw his work hooted from the stage, and
John passing from his life, and the sot's bloated mouth
babbling filth at him.  His nerves were all shaken to
pieces by the emotional strain of the past fortnight.
He was in a child's mood; the mood of the homesick
boy at school.  He was as dangerously near hysteria as
the drunkard.  He longed to be over in Ireland, in the
house of that beautiful woman whom he loved, to be in
the presence of calm and tenderness and noble thought,
away from all these horrors and desolations.  The
thought of Ottalie Fawcett calmed him; for he could
not think of that beautiful woman and of himself at
the same time.  Memories of her gave his mind a sweet,
melancholy food.  One memory especially, of the beautiful
lady, in her beautiful, early Victorian dress, with
great hat, grey gauntlets, and old pearl earrings,
bending over a mass of white roses in the garden, recurred
again and again.  To think of her intently, and to see
her very clearly in a mind acutely excited, was like
communion with her.  Her image was so sharply outlined
in his heart that he felt an exultation, as though their
hearts were flowing into each other.  One tingling
thought of her was like her heart against his.  It made
him sure that she was thinking of him at that instant,
perhaps with tenderness.  He tried to imagine her
thoughts of him.  He tried to imagine himself her,
looking out under that great hat, through those lively
eyes, a beautiful, charming woman, exquisite, guarded,
and infinitely swift of tact.  It ended with a passionate
longing to get away to Ireland to see her, cost what
it might.  His heart turned to her; he would go to
her.  He could not live without love.
</p>

<p>
The play had ended before ten o'clock.  It was now
half-past eleven.  Roger paid his bill, and turned into
Shaftesbury Avenue, thinking that within thirty-six
hours he would be set free.  This dusty tumult would
be roaring to other ears.  He would be by the waters of
Moyle, among magical glens, knocking at his love's
door, walking with her, hearing her voice, sitting with
her over the turf fire, in that old house on the hills,
looking over towards Ailsa.  That would be life enough.
It would give him strength to begin again after his
failure and the loss of his friend.  His mind was full of
her.  He turned, as he had so often turned, late at
night, to look at the windows of the little upper flat
which his love shared with her friend Agatha Carew-Ker.
They were seldom in town to use the flat.  They
came there for flying visits generally in the spring and
winter, when passing through London to the Continent.
It was a tiny flat of four living-rooms, high up, on the
south side of Shaftesbury Avenue; a strange place for
two ladies to have chosen, but it was near the theatres
and shops.  As Roger walked towards it he recalled the
last time he had been there, seven months before.  He
had had tea alone with Ottalie, one misty October
evening.  For nearly half an hour they were alone in the
flat, sitting together by the fire in the dusk, talking
intimately, even tenderly; for there was something
magical in the twilight, and the companionship was too
close, during that rare half-hour, for either to light the
lamp.  He had known Ottalie since childhood; but
never before like this.  Her tenderness and charm and
grave beauty had never been so near to him.  Two
minutes more in that dusk would have brought him to her
side.  He would have taken her hands in his.  He
would have asked her if life could go back again, after
such communion, to the old frank comradeship.  Then
Agatha came in, with her hardness and bustle and
suspicion.  The spell had been broken.  Agatha rated
them for sitting in the dark.  When he lighted the
lamp, he was conscious of Agatha's sharp critical eye
upon him, and of a certain reproachful jealousy in her
tone towards Ottalie.  There were little hard glances
from one face to the other; and then some ill-concealed
feminine manoeuvring to make it impossible for him to
stay longer.  He stayed until Agatha became pointed.
That was the last time he had seen Ottalie.  He had
heard from her from time to time.  He had sent her
his last novel and his book of tales.  She had sent him
a silver match-box as a Christmas present.  Agatha, in
a postscript, had conveyed her "love" to him.
</p>

<p>
He paused on the north side of the avenue to look
at the flat windows high up on the opposite side.  He
was startled to see a light in Ottalie's bedroom, a long
gleam of light where the curtains parted, a gleam
dimmed momentarily by some one passing.  For five
seconds he saw the light, then it was blown out.  Some
one was in the flat, possibly Ottalie herself.  He might,
perhaps, see her early the next morning.  She might be
there, just across the road.  She might have been
within three hundred yards of him for this last miserable
hour; but it was strange that she had not written to tell
him that she was coming to town.  It could hardly be
Ottalie.  It might be Agatha, or some friend to whom
they had lent the flat for the season.  He was eager
now for the next day to dawn, so that he might find out.
He was utterly weary.  He hailed a cab and drove to
his rooms in Westminster.  The cabman, thinking him
an easy subject, demanded more than the excess fare
given to him.  Roger told him that he would get no
more, and entered the house.  The cabman, becoming
abusive, climbed down and battered at the knocker, till
the approach of a policeman warned him that any
further attempts might lead to a summons.  He drove
away growling.
</p>

<p>
Roger lived in chambers in one of the old houses of
Westminster.  He rented a little panelled sitting-room,
a bedroom, also panelled, rather larger, and a third
room so tiny that a clothes-press and a bath almost filled
it.  He lit his lamp to see what letters had come for
him.  There were five or six, none of them from
Ottalie.  A telegram lay on the table.  It was from an
evening paper asking for the favour of an interview
early the next morning.  The row at the theatre was
bearing fruit.  He opened his letters; but, seeing that
they were not amusing, he did not read them.  He went
into his bedroom to undress.  On the mantelpiece was
a rehearsal call card, which had given him a thrill of
pleasure a fortnight before.  Now it seemed to grin at
him with a devilish inanimate malice.  An etched
portrait of O'Neill looked down mournfully from the wall.
A photograph of Ottalie on the dressing-table was the
last thing noticed by him as he blew out the lamp.
</p>

<p>
In the next house a member of Parliament lived.
His wife was musical, in a hard, accomplished way.
She sang cleverly, though her voice was not good.  She
sang as her excellent masters had taught her to sing.
She had profited by their teaching to the limits of her
nature.  In moments of emotion, when she recognised
her shortcomings, she quoted to herself a line from Abt
Vogler, "On the earth a broken arc, in the heaven a
perfect round."  She was an irregular, eccentric lady,
fond of late hours.  This night some wandering devil
caused her to begin to play at midnight, when Roger,
utterly exhausted by the strain of the evening, was
falling to a merciful sleep.  A few bars was enough to
waken Roger.  The wall between them was not thick
enough to dull the noise.  The few melancholy bars
gathered volume.  She began to sing with hard, metallic,
callousness, with disillusion in each note.  Poor
lady, the moment was beautiful to her.  She could not
know that she, in her moment of delight, was an
instrument of the malevolent stars next door.  Roger sat up
in bed with a few impatient words.  He knew the
lady's song; he had heard Ottalie sing it.  Hearing this
other lady sing it was instructive.  It confirmed him in
a theory held by him, that refinement was a quality of
the entire personality; that delicacy of feeling, beauty
of nature, niceness of tact, were shown in the least
movement, in the raising of a hand, in the head's carriage, in
the least sound of the voice.  Ottalie sang with all the
beauty of her character, giving to each note an
indescribable rightness of value, verbal as well as musical,
conveying to her hearers a sense of her distinction of
soul, a sense of the noble living of dead generations of
Fawcetts; a sense of style and race and personal
exquisiteness.  This lady sang as though she were out in
a hockey field, charging the ball healthily, in short
skirts, among many gay young sprigs from the barracks.
She sang like the daughter of a <i>nouveau riche</i>.  Her
song was a brief liaison between Leipzig and a vulgar
constitution.
</p>

<p>
Two minutes of her song put all thought of sleep from
Roger's mind.  He lit his lamp and searched for some
cigarettes.  Something prompted him to take down
Wentworth's <i>Tragedy of Poppaea</i>.  He would read it
over until the lady's muscles tired.  He lit a cigarette.
Propping himself up with pillows he began to read,
admiring the precise firmness of the rhythms, and that
quality in the style which was all fragrance and
glimmer, a fine bloom of beauty, never too much, which
marked the artist.  The choruses moved him by their
inherent music.  They were musical because the man's
mind, though sternly muscular and manly, was full of
melody.  They were unlike most modern verse, which
is reckoned musical when it shows some mechanical
compliance with a pattern of music already in the popular
ear.  Roger, as a writer not yet formed, was curious in
all things which showed personal distinction and striving.
This exquisite verse, this power of fine, precise
intellectual conception, was reward enough, he thought,
for the misery which this poet had suffered from his
fellows.  Roger wondered how many ladies like the
singer on the other side of the wall had asked poor
Wentworth to their "At Homes" for any but a vulgar
reason.  He remembered how Wentworth, a strict
moralist soured by a life of suffering, had spoken to one
lady.  "You will buy my books and lay them on your
tables.  You will ask me to dinner to amuse yourself
with my talk.  You have won a reputation for wit by
repeating my epigrams.  And for which of my ideas do
you care two straws, for which would you sacrifice one
least vanity, for which would you outrage one convention?
I will come to your 'At Home.'"
</p>

<p>
The cigarette was smoked out.  The lady, having
finished some four songs, now toyed with a little Grieg,
a little Bach, a little Schumann, like a delicate butterfly
flying by the finest clockwork.  Roger, who was now
in no mood for sleep, found the music of some value as
an accompaniment to <i>Poppaea</i>.  It was like the light
and excitement of a theatre, added to the emotion of
the poetry.  He read through to the end of the second
act, when his eyes began to trouble him.  Then he rose,
hurriedly dressed, wrapped himself in a Chinese robe,
embroidered with green silk dragons, and passed
through his sitting-room window on to the balcony above
the street.  It was a narrow, old-fashioned balcony, big
enough for three people, if the people were fond of each
other.  Structurally it was a part of the balcony of the
member's house, but an old straw trellis-work divided
the two tenancies at the party wall.  Roger placed a
deck-chair with its back against the trellis, which shut
off the member's balcony from his.  He was sheltered
from above by a green verandah canopy, and from the
street by another trellis about five feet high.  He would
not sleep now, until four; he knew his symptoms of
old.  He could not read.  It was useless to lie tossing
in bed.  He sat in the deck-chair mournfully munching
salted almonds.  He was in a state of unnatural
nervous excitement.  The music came through the house
delicately to him, softened by two walls, one of them
honestly built in the late seventeenth century.  He
thought that John O'Neill would be distant music to
him henceforth.  Perhaps the dead look on the living
souls as notes in a music, and play upon them, making
harmony or discord, according to the power of their
wills and the quality of their nature.  He could
imagine John, who had stricken so many living souls to
music, playing on in death, not hampered by the
indifference of any one note, but playing upon it masterly,
rousing it to music, by striking some kindred note,
reaching it through another, as perhaps our dead
friends can.  But life would be terrible without John.
He remembered how Lamb walked about muttering
"Coleridge is dead."  A great spirit never expresses
herself perfectly.  She needs many lesser spirits to
catch those glittering crumbs and fiery-flung manna
seeds.  When the bread passes, the disciples serve
scraps and preach bakery.
</p>

<p>
He finished his salted almonds regretfully, remembering
that he was out of olives.  He lighted another
cigarette, and lay there smoking, trying to get calm.
It was very still but for the music; for Davenant Street
was as quiet as Dean's Yard.  The windows were all
blank and dark; people were sleeping.  Big Ben's
noble tone told the quarters.  A policeman went past
softly, feeling at the doors.  Something went wrong in
the street lamp a few yards from Roger's perch.  It
fluttered as though some great moth were struggling in
the flame.  It died down to a few flagging points of
light, leaving the dark street even darker.  Big Ben,
lifting a solemn sweet voice, tolled two, with noble
melancholy, resigned to death, but hungry for the beauty
of life, like the spirit of Raleigh speaking.  Ottalie was
asleep now, the grey eyes shut, the sweet face lying
trustful.  John was with the pale young Spaniard,
doing what? in the room high aloft there, over Queen
Square.  London was about to take its hour of quiet.
Only the poets, the scholars, and the idlers were awake
now.  In a little while the May dawn would begin.
Even now it was tingeing the cherry blossom in Aleppo.
The roses of Sarvistan were spilling in the heat.  The
blades of green corn by Troy gleamed above the river
as the wind shook them.  Tenedos rose up black, watching
the channel, now showing steel.
</p>

<p>
Roger lighted another cigarette from the embers of
the last.  It was too quiet to strike a match.  The
stillness gave him an emotional pleasure.  It gave him a
sense of power, as though he were the only living spirit
in the midst of all this death.  He was sorry when the
music stopped, for it had made the stillness more
impressive.  If his thoughts had not been calmed by it,
they had at least been made more beautiful, chaotic as
they were.  The bitterness of the night worked less
bitingly.  He was conscious of an exaltation of the
mind.  Up there in the quiet, his devotion to John, his
passion for Ottalie, and his love of all high and noble
art, seemed co-ordinated in a grand scheme in which
he was both god and man.  Standing up, he looked over
the trellis into the street, deeply moved.  He was here
to perfect that magnificent work of art,&mdash;himself.
John, who had pointed the way, was gone now.
Ottalie, who had inspired him, was waiting with her
crown; or perhaps only showing it to lure him, for
Nature, prodigal of dust and weed, gives true beauty
sparingly.  It was for him to follow that lure and to gather
strength to seize it.  The world was a little dust under
his feet.  In his soul was a little green seed bursting.
It would grow up out of all the grime and muck of
modern life, among all the flying grit of the air, into
a stately tree, which would shelter the world with
beauty and peace.  He would be a supreme soul.  He
would dominate this rabble which hooted him.
</p>

<p>
He lit another cigarette.  John was like a man sent
from God.  John was unreal.  John had marched
before him with a torch.  Now that ghostly master of
his had thrust the torch into the road, pointing him
forward with a gesture.  The way to perfection lay
further on, along a path too narrow for two.  Far up
the path he could see Ottalie, a glimmer of fragrant
beauty, half hidden in a whirling dust-storm which
almost swept him off the ledge.  The dust should not
keep him from her.  He would climb to her.  They
would go on together.
</p>

<p>
At this instant, as the melancholy intensity of the
bells tolled the quarter-hour, the window-door opened
on the other side of the straw trellis.  A lady came out
on to the balcony.  She hummed one of Heine's songs
in a little low voice, which left the music full of gaps.
Roger recognised the singer's voice.  He wondered if
her husband were with her.  He supposed that he must
be at the House, and that she was waiting for him.
Her skirts rustled as she moved.  A faint scent of
violet attracted Roger to her.  It was faint, exotic, and
suggestive.  There is an intoxication in perfumes.  She
stood there for a full ten seconds before she divined his
presence beyond the screen.  Her song stopped
instantly.  Two seconds more convinced her that the
person was male and alone.  A third suggested that he
was a burglar.
</p>

<p>
"Who is there?" she said quietly.  Her voice was
anxious rather than fearful.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so sorry," said Roger.  He did not know what
else to say.  "I live here."  He thought that it would
be polite to go indoors.  He turned to go.  To his
surprise she spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"Can you give me a cigarette?" she said.  She still
spoke quietly.  She spoke as if a maidservant were in
the room behind her.  Roger was flustered.  He was a
man of quick blood in a condition of excited nerves.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said.  "Will you have Russian, or American,
or Turkish?"
</p>

<p>
She appeared to debate for an instant.
</p>

<p>
"Give me a Russian," she said.  "Give it to me
through this hole in the matting.  Thanks."
</p>

<p>
"Have you a match?" Roger asked.
</p>

<p>
"No," she answered.  "Give me a light from yours,
please.  Don't set the mat on fire, though."
</p>

<p>
He thrust his burning cigarette through the hole in
the matting.  He felt the pressure of her cigarette upon
it.  He heard her quickened breathing.  He saw the
glow brightening through the mat as the tobacco
kindled.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," she said softly, with a little half-laugh.
"How did the play go?"
</p>

<p>
"The play?" Roger stammered.  "It was&mdash;&mdash;  Do
you mean&mdash;&mdash;  Which play do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Your play; <i>The Roman Matron</i>.  You are Mr. Naldrett,
aren't you?  I met you once for a moment
at a house in Chelsea.  At Mrs. Melyard's, three years
ago.  I was just going."
</p>

<p>
He remembered that hectic beauty Mrs. Melyard.
She was like a green snake.  She used to receive her
intimates (she had no friends) in a room hung with
viridian.  There were green couches, green-shaded
lights, a gum burning greenly in a brazier with green
glass sides.  She herself was dressed in green, glittering,
metallic scales, which made a noise like serpent's
hissing as she glided.  "Nothing is really interesting
except vice," was the only phrase which he could
remember of Mrs. Melyard's conversation.  She was a
feverish character, explained by inherited phthisical
taint.  Melyard collected tsuba, and fenced archæologically
at the Foil Club.  He was the best rapier and
dagger man in England.
</p>

<p>
"You are Mrs. Templeton?" he asked.  "I remember
a lady at Mrs. Melyard's."
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't married then," she said quickly.  "How
did the play go?"
</p>

<p>
"It was booed off."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," she said.  She meant "I am sorry that
I asked."
</p>

<p>
Roger wondered how he could get away.  It
depended on the lady.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you sleep?" she asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"I can't.  Will it bore you to come in to talk to us?"
</p>

<p>
He was used to unconventional people.  He saw
nothing strange in the woman's invitation.  Most of
the women known to him would have acted as simply
and as frankly in the same circumstances.  He knew
that Templeton seldom went to bed before two.  He
took it for granted that Templeton was in the
sitting-room; possibly within earshot.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not very presentable," he said.  "Let me
change this robe."
</p>

<p>
"We shan't mind," she said, reassuring him.
"Come on."
</p>

<p>
"Will you let me in?"
</p>

<p>
"We'll pull down this screen."
</p>

<p>
They pulled down the old matting with two vigorous
jerks.  Roger stepped across the partition into the
further balcony.
</p>

<p>
"Come in," she said, passing through the window.
"It's dark inside here.  Take care of the chair there."  She
put out a hand to pull the chair away.  She did it
roughly, making a good deal of noise.
</p>

<p>
"You sit here," she said.  "That chair's comfy.
I'll sit here, opposite; here's an ash-tray."
</p>

<p>
"Could I light a lamp or candle?" Roger asked,
taking out his match-box.
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks," she said.  "Don't light up just yet;
I'm sick of light.  I wish we could live in the dark, like
wild beasts."
</p>

<p>
"London is on your nerves," said Roger.  "The
noise and worry are upsetting you.  You are tired of
London, not of light."
</p>

<p>
He was disappointed by being asked to sit in darkness.
He began to lose interest in the lady.  She was
only a modern dramatic heroine, i.e.  a common woman
overstrained.  He had heard similar affected silliness
from a dozen empty women, some of them pretty.  He
had heard that Mrs. Templeton was pretty.  As she
refused light, he decided that fame had lied.  "She
must be a blonde," he thought, "and this room is lit
by electricity."  He wished that Templeton would
come.  Templeton would make the situation easier, and
his wife's talk more sensible.  The lady was silently
trying to sum him up.
</p>

<p>
"No; I'm not tired of London," she was saying.
"Only one cannot <i>live</i> in London."
</p>

<p>
"London is on your nerves," Roger repeated.
"London is a feverish great spider.  It sucks out
vitality, and leaves its own poison instead.  Look at the
arts.  A young artist comes up here full of vitality.
Unless he is a truly great man, London will suck it all
out of him, and make him as poisonous and as feverish
as herself."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that is quite true," she answered.  "I wish
we could all be simple and natural, and have time to
live.  Life is so interestin'.  The only really
interestin' thing."
</p>

<p>
"What kind of life do you wish to live?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish to live my own life.  I want to know my
own soul.  To live.  In London one is always livin'
other people's lives, goin' dinin', doin' things because
other people do them.  But where else can you meet
interestin' people?"
</p>

<p>
"People are not essential to true life," said Roger.
"I believe that all perfect life is communion with God,
conversation, that is, with ideas; 'godly conversation.'  People
are to some extent like thoughts, like living
ideas; for the inner and the outer lives correspond."
</p>

<p>
"You mean that life is a kind of curve?" the lady
interrupted.  The question was a moral boomerang.
She often used it defensively; she had once felled a
scientist with it.
</p>

<p>
"Life is whatever you like to make it."
</p>

<p>
"I'm thinkin' of goin' to live in Ireland," said the
lady.  "The people must be so exquisitely charmin'.
Such a beautiful life, sittin' round the fire, singin' the
old songs.  And then their imagination!"
</p>

<p>
"Their charm is superficial," said Roger.  "Taking
the times together, I've lived in Ireland for seven years.
I have a cottage there.  I do not think that you will sit
round many fires, to sing old songs, after the first fine
careless rapture, which lasts a month.  I'm an Englishman,
of course.  When in Ireland I'm only one of the
English garrison.  I may be wanting in sympathy; but
I maintain that the Irish have no imagination.
Imagination is a moral quality."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think an Englishman can understand the
Irish," said the lady.
</p>

<p>
"When an Irishman is great enough to escape from
the littleness of his race, he becomes a very splendid
person," Roger answered.  "But until that happens he
seems to me to be wanting in any really fundamental
quality."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said the lady, "you are talking so very like
an Englishman.  You aren't interested in life, I see.
You are only interested in morals.  But you cannot say
that the Irish have no imagination.  They have
wonderful imagination.  Look at the way they talk.  And
their writers: Swift, Goldsmith, Sheridan.  And
their own exquisite Irish poets."
</p>

<p>
"I'd give the whole company for one act of Addison's
<i>Cato</i>," said Roger.  "Swift had a limited vision
and a diseased mind.  He diagnosed his own diseases.
Goldsmith wrote some pretty verses.  But I do not
think that you have read them.  Have you?  Sheridan
wrote a comedy at the age of twenty-four to prove that
a sot is nobler than a scholar.  Later, he tried to prove
it in his own person.  I do not read Irish.  I have read
translations from it.  Its distinctive quality seemed
to me to be just that kind of windy impersonality which
one hears in their talk."
</p>

<p>
"That is so English of you," said the lady, laughing.
"I think that I ought to be very thankful for my Celtic
blood."
</p>

<p>
"Are you a Celt?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; from Cornwall.  I think it gives me an
instinctive love of the beautiful."
</p>

<p>
"Those who love beauty make it.  I, too, have been
a Celt.  I was a Celt from my twenty-second till my
twenty-fifth year.  Then I discovered a very curious
fact&mdash;two facts."
</p>

<p>
"What were they?"
</p>

<p>
"First, that the Celt's love of the beautiful is all
bunkum.  Second, that the people of these islands are
mongrels, bred from the scum of Europe.  You can call
yourself an Anglo-Saxon, or a Celt, or an Aryan, or a
Norman, or a Long-Barrow Palæolith; but if you came
from these islands, you are a mongrel, a mongrel of a
most chequered kind."
</p>

<p>
At this instant the door opened suddenly, and the
electric light was turned on.  In the doorway stood
Templeton&mdash;a tall, bald, thin-faced man, with foxy
moustache and weak eyes.  His face showed amazed anger.
</p>

<p>
"What is this?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Let me introduce you," said the lady.  "My husband,
Mr. Naldrett."
</p>

<p>
Roger, standing up under the angry gaze of Templeton,
was conscious of looking like a fool, in his robe of
green silk dragons.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand," said Templeton.
</p>

<p>
"I asked Mr. Naldrett here to talk to me," said the
lady.
</p>

<p>
"So I presume," said Templeton.
</p>

<p>
"Have you had an interesting sitting?" Roger asked.
</p>

<p>
Templeton did not answer.  He was glaring at his
wife.  His opera hat was tilted back; his overcoat was
unbuttoned; an unlighted cigarette drooped from his
mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Archie," said the lady suavely, "Mr. Naldrett is
my friend.  I asked him here to talk to me."
</p>

<p>
"So I see," said Templeton.
</p>

<p>
"To talk to me," the woman repeated, flaring up,
"while you were with Mrs. Liancourt at her flat in
St. Anne's Mansions.  I know when the House rose, and
where you went afterwards.  If you're goin' to have
your friends, I'm goin' to have mine."
</p>

<p>
Templeton seemed to gulp.  He turned to Roger.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you will go," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think I had better," said Roger.  "I am
sorry that I came."
</p>

<p>
He rose to go.  Mrs. Templeton turned to him.
</p>

<p>
"A quarter to three," she said sweetly.  "You will
remember that?"
</p>

<p>
Roger looked hard at Mrs. Templeton.  Never again
would he speak civilly to a woman with high cheek-bones,
steel eyes, and loose mouth.  He bowed to her.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't deserve it," he said quietly.  He walked to
the window-door, feeling like some discovered lover in a
play.  As he entered the balcony, Templeton slammed
to the door behind him with a snarl of "Now," as he
opened fire on his wife.  Templeton's flanks were
turned.  He was blowing up his ammunition wagons
before surrendering.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Roger felt furious with Templeton.
Then he blamed the lady.  She had played him a scurvy
trick.  Lastly, as he began to understand her position,
he forgave her.  He blamed himself.  He felt that he
had mixed himself with something indescribably
squalid.
</p>

<p>
As he undressed for bed he blamed the world for its
vulgarity, and dreariness, and savagery.  The world
was too much with him.  It was thwarting, and blighting,
and destroying him.  He longed to get away from
the world.  Anywhere.  To those Irish hills above the
sea, to his beautiful friend, to some peaceful, gentle
life, where the squalor of his night's adventures would
be unknown and unremembered.  He felt contaminated.
He longed to purify himself in the sea below his
love's home.  He thought of that water.  He saw it lit
by the sun, with tremulous brown sea-leaves folding.
Sand at the bottom, six feet down, made a wrinkled
blur of paleness, across which a lobster crawled.  He
would go there.  In fifteen hours he would be tearing
towards it through the night, past the great glaring
towns, on into the hills, to the sea.
</p>

<p>
A thought of the shaking of the train, and of the
uneasy sleep of the people in the carriage, merged
gradually into the blur which precedes unconsciousness.
Before Big Ben tolled four he was asleep, in that kind
of restless nightmare which chains the will without
chaining the intelligence.  In that kind of sleep which
is not sleep he dreamed a dream of Ottalie, which
awakened him, in sudden terror, at seven.

<p class="poem2">
  I prythee, sorrow, leave a little room<br />
  In my confounded and tormented mind<br />
  For understanding to deliberate<br />
  The cause or author of this accident.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Atheist's Tragedy</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He thought, as he sat up, that an instant before
his true self had walked in the spiritual
kingdom, apprehending beauty.  Now, with
the shock of waking, the glory wavered, like a fire of
wet wood, fitfully, among the smoke of the daily life
flooding back in his brain's channels.  The memory of
the beauty came in gleams, moving him to the bone, for
it seemed to him that the spirit of his love had moved
in the chambers of his brain, bringing a message to
him, while the dulnesses of his body lay arrested.  A
dream so beautiful must, he thought, be a token of all
beauty, a sign, perhaps, that her nature was linked to
his, for some ecstatic purpose, by the power outside life.
Her beauty, her sweetness, her intense, personal charm,
all the sacredness that clothed her about, had walked
with him in one of the gardens of the soul.  That was
glory enough; but the dream was intense and full of
mystery; it had brought him very near to something
awful and immortal, so strange and mighty that only
a heart's tick, something in the blood, had kept him
from the presence of the symbol-maker, and from the
full knowledge of the beauty of the meaning of life.
</p>

<p>
The vision seemed meaningless when pieced together.
Words in it had seemed revelations, acts in it
adventures, romances; but judged by the waking mind, it
was unintelligible, though holy, like a Mass in an
unknown tongue.
</p>

<p>
He had found her in the garden at her home, among
flowers lovelier than earthly flowers, among flowers like
flames and precious stones.  That was the beginning of
it.  Then in the sweetness of their talk he had become
conscious of all that her love meant to him, of all that
it meant to the power which directs life, of all that his
failure to win her would mean, here and hereafter.
Life had seemed suddenly terrible and glorious, a
wrestle of God and devil for each soul.  With this
consciousness had come a change in the dream.  She had
gone from him.
</p>

<p>
That was the middle of it.  Then that also changed.
She had left him to seek for her through the world.
Suddenly she had sent a message to him.  He was walking
to meet her.  Delight filled him as wine fills a cup.
He would see her, he would touch her hand, her eyes
would look into his.  He had never before been so
moved by the love of her.  His delight was not the old
selfish pleasure, but a rapturous comprehension of her
beauty, and of that of which her beauty was the symbol.
He knew, as he walked, that the beloved life in her was
his own finer self, longing to transmute him to her
brightness.  A word, a touch, a look, and they would be
together in nobleness; he would breathe the beauty of
her character like pure air, he would be a part of her
forever.
</p>

<p>
So he had walked the streets to her, noticing nothing
except the brightness of the sun on the houses, till he
had stood upon the stair-top knocking vainly at the door
of an empty house.  It came upon him then with an
exhaustion of the soul, like death itself, that he had
come too late.  She had gone away disappointed,
perhaps angry.  The door would never open to him; he
would never meet her again; never even enter the hall,
dimly seen through the glass, to gather relics of her.
Within, as he could see, lay a handkerchief and a
withered flower once worn by her, little relics bitterly
precious, to be nursed in his heart in a rapture of agony,
could he only have them.  But he had come too late;
he had lost her; his heart, wanting her, would be empty
always, a dead thing going through life like a machine.
In his vision he could see across to Ireland, to her
home.  He could see her there; sad that she had not
seen him.  He had tried to wade to her through a
channel full of thorns, which held him fast.  From the
midst of the thorns he could see a young man, with
a calm, strong face, talking to her.  Shaken as he was
by grief, and prepared for any evil, he realised that
this youth was to be her mate, now that he had lost
her.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, at the end of the dream, he had received a
letter from her, with the postmark Athens across the
Greek stamp.  The letter had been the most real part
of the dream.  It was her very hand, a dashing, virile
hand, with weak, unusual f's, t's crossed far to the right
of their uprights, and a negligent beauty in some of the
curves of the capitals.  The letters were small, the
down-strokes determined but irregular, never twice the
same.  It was the hand of a vivid, charming, but not
very strong character.  He could not remember what
the letter said.  Only one sentence at the end remained.
"I have read your last book," it ran; "it reads like
the diary of a lost soul."  There was no signature;
nothing but the paper, with the intensely vivid writing,
and that one sentence plainly visible.  It was even
sound criticism.  The book of sketches had been
self-conscious experiments in style, detached, pictorial
presentation of crises, clever things in their way, but
startling, both in colour and in subject, the results of
moods, not of perfected personality.  The sketches had
been ill-assorted; that was another fault.  But he had
not thought them evil.  Sitting up in bed, with the
damning sentence still vivid, he felt that they must
be evil, because she disliked them.  He had created
brutal, erring, passionate, and wicked types, with frank
and natural creative power.  At this moment he felt
himself judged.  He felt for the first time that the
theories of art common to the little party of his friends,
were not so much theories of art as declarations of
youthful independence, soiled with personal failures of
perception and personal antipathies.  He was wrong;
his art was all wrong; his art was all self-indulgence,
not self-perfection.  An artist had no right to create at
pleasure, ignoble types and situations, fixing fragments
of the perishing to the walls of the world, as a keeper
nails vermin.  Ottalie's fair nature was not nourished
on such work.  Great art called such work "sin,"
"denial of the Holy Ghost," "crucifixion of our Lord."  He
reached for the offending book; but the words
seemed meaningless; some of the intricate prose-rhythms
were clever.  But anybody can do mechanics
and transcribe.  Style and imagination are the difficult
things.  He put the book aside, wondering if he
would ever do good work.
</p>

<p>
He was haunted by the dream until he was dressed.
Then the memories of the night before came in upon
him, the yells of the mob, hooting his soul's child, the
bloated face of the sot, his friend's farewell that had
had neither warning nor affection, the indignity of the
visit to the Templetons', till the world seemed to be
pressing its shapeless head upon his windows, shrieking
insults at him, through yielding glass.  He began
to realise that he had had the concentrated torment
of months suddenly stamped upon him in a night.  His
work, his person, his affections, his social nature had
all been trampled and defiled.  He wondered what
more torments were coming to him with the new day.
Some forethought of what was coming crossed his mind
when he saw his breakfast-table.  Beside his teacup
were three or four daily papers, in which, in clear type,
were set forth the opinions of Britain's moral guardians
concerning their immoral brother.
</p>

<p>
There were letters first, some of them left from the
night before.  An obscure acquaintance, a lady in
Somersetshire, sent some verses, asking for his
criticism, and for the address of "a publisher who would
pay for them."  One of the poems began
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Hark! hark! hark!<br />
  'Tis the song of the Lark,<br />
  Dewy with spangles of morn."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A second letter from the same lady enclosed a "Poem
on My Cat Peter," which had been accidentally omitted
from the other envelope.  His agent sent him a very
welcome cheque for £108, for his newly completed novel.
Next came a letter from a stranger, asking for permission
to set some verses to music.  A charitable countess
asked for verses for her new Bazaar Book.  An American
News Cutting Bureau sent a little bundle of reviews
of his book of sketches.  The wrapper on the
bundle bore a legend in red ink:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We mail you 45 clippings of <i>The Handful</i>.  Has
your Agency sent you that many?  If you like our way
of business, mail us $1.50, and we will continue to
collect clippings under your name."
</p>

<p>
He disliked their way of business.  He flung the
clippings unread into the fireplace.  The next letter
asked him to lecture to the Torchbearers' Guild, who,
it seemed, admired "the virile manliness" of his style.
Last of all came a letter from an unknown clergyman
denouncing the pernicious influence of <i>The Handful</i> in
words which, without being rude, were offensive beyond
measure.  He took up the papers.
</p>

<p>
The first paper, <i>The Daily Dawn</i>, treated him <i>d'haut
en bas</i>, as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"M. Falempin's latest theatrical adventure, <i>A
Roman Matron</i>, by Mr. Roger Naldrett (whom we suspect,
from internal evidence, to be a not very old lady),
was produced last night at the King's Theatre.  As
far as the audience permitted us to judge, before the
piece ended in a storm of groans, we think that it is
entirely unsuited to the modern stage.  The character
of Petronius, finely played by Mr. Danvers, showed
some power of psychological analysis; but Mr. (or
Miss) Naldrett would do well to remember that the
Aristotelian definition of tragedy cannot be disregarded
lightly."
</p>

<p>
The criticism in the second paper, <i>The Dayspring</i>,
was written in more stately prose than that of <i>The
Dawn</i>.
</p>

<p>
"An unreasonable amount of excitement was begotten
by the entourage," it ran; "but the piece, which
was dull, and occasionally disgusting, convinced us that
the New Drama, about which we have heard so much
lately, would do better to adequately study a drama
more germane to modern ideas, such as we fortunately
possess, than libel the institutions from which our
glorious Constitution is derived," which was certainly a
home-thrust from <i>The Dayspring</i>.
</p>

<p>
The third paper, <i>The Morning</i>, in its news column,
referred to a disgraceful <i>fracas</i> at the King's Theatre.
"The police," said <i>The Morning</i>, "were soon on the
spot, and removed the more noisy members of the
audience.  Neither M. Falempin, the manager of the
theatre, nor Miss Hanlon, who took a leading part in the
offending play, would consent to be interviewed, when
waited on, late last night, by a representative of this
paper."
</p>

<p>
The fourth paper, <i>The Day</i>, said savagely that <i>The
Matron</i> should never have passed the Censor, and that
its production was an indelible blot on M. Falempin's
(hitherto spotless) artistic record.  Roger had written
occasional reviews for <i>The Day</i>, about a dozen, all told.
On the same page, and in the column next to that
containing the "Dramatic Notes," was a review signed by
him.  Roger turned to this review, to see how it read.
It was a review of a worthless book of verse by a
successful versifier.  The literary editor of <i>The Day</i> had
asked Roger to write a column on the book.  As the
book deserved, at most, three scathing words in a
Dunciad, Roger had written a column about poetry, a very
pretty piece of critical writing, worth five thousand such
books fifty times over.  Its only fault was that, being
about poetry, it had little reference to the book of verse
by the successful poet.  So the literary editor had
"cut" and "written in" and altered the article, till
Roger, reading it, on this tragical morning, found
himself self-accused of despicable truckling to Mammon,
and the palliation of iniquity, in sentences the rhythms
of which jarred, and in platitudes which stung him.
He flung down the paper.  He would never again write
for <i>The Day</i>.  He would never write another word for
any daily or weekly paper.  He remembered what
d'Arthez says in <i>Les Illusions Perdues</i>.  He blamed
himself for not having remembered before.
</p>

<p>
He ate very hurriedly, so that he might lose no time
in getting to the flat in Shaftesbury Avenue, to find out
if Ottalie were really there.  Ottalie; the sight of
Ottalie; the sound of her voice even, would end his
troubles for him.  The thought of her calmed him.  The
thought of her brought back the dream, with a glow of
pleasure.  The dream came and went in his mind,
seeming now strange, now beautiful.  His impression of it
was that given by all moving dreams.  He thought of
it as a kind of divine adventure in which he had taken
part.  He felt that he had apprehended spiritually the
mysterious life beyond ours, and had learned, finally,
forever, that Ottalie's soul was linked to his soul by
bonds forged by powers greater than man.  A cab came
clattering up.  There came a vehement knocking at the
outer door.  "Ottalie," he thought.  Selina, the
house-maid, entered.
</p>

<p>
"A lady to see you, sir," she said.
</p>

<p>
He stood up, gulping, expecting Ottalie.  The lady
entered.  She was not Ottalie.  She was a total
stranger in a state of great excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Are you Mr. Naldrett, sir?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Yes.  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Pollock's compliments, sir, and will you please
come round at once?"
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"It's Mr. Pollock, sir.  He's had a fit or somethink.
He's lying in the grate with all the blood gone to his
apalex."
</p>

<p>
"Right," said Roger, stuffing his letters into his
pockets.  "I'll come.  When did it happen?"
</p>

<p>
"Just now, sir.  He'd just gone into the studio, to
begin his painting.  Then there came a crash.  And
the missus and I rush in, and there he was in the grate,
sir."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Yes.  Have you sent for a doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  The missus said to go for you."
</p>

<p>
They galloped off in the cab together.  Pollock with
the bloody apalex was a young artist whose studio was
in Vincent Square.  Roger was fond of him.  He had
shared rooms with him until his marriage.  Roger
wondered as he drove what was going to happen to the wife
if Pollock died.  She was expecting a child.  Pollock
hadn't made much, poor fellow.
</p>

<p>
"Very beautiful paintings, Mr. Pollock does, sir,"
said the lady with enthusiasm.  "Oh, he does them
beautiful.  But they're not like ordinary pictures.  I
mean, they're not pretty, like ordinary pictures.
They're like old-fashioned pictures."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Roger.  "Tell me.  Is his big picture
finished?  The one with the lady under a stained-glass
window."
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  It's got a lot to do yet, sir.  O I 'ope
nothink's going to 'appen to 'im, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Now here we are," said Roger, as the cab slackened.
"Now you drive to the corner there.  You'll
see a brass plate with DR. COLLINSON on it at the
corner house.  Tell him to get into the cab with you and
come round at once.  Go on, now.  See that he comes
at once."
</p>

<p>
The door of the flat stood open.  Roger entered
hurriedly.  Just inside he ran against Pollock, who was
hastening with a jug of water from the bathroom.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Pollock?  Are you better?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm all right," said Pollock, feeling a bandaged
head.  "It's Kitty.  Not me.  Come on in, quick."
</p>

<p>
"But I thought you were having apoplexy."
</p>

<p>
"That heavy frame full of Dürers came down.  The
corner caught me over the eye while I was standing by
the mantelpiece.  It knocked me out.  Come on in.  I
believe Kitty's in a bad way."
</p>

<p>
Kitty lay on a couch.  Her face was not like a
human being's face.  Pollock, very white, sponged her
brow with cold water.
</p>

<p>
"There, dear," he kept saying, "O God, O God,
O God," those words, over and over again.
</p>

<p>
Roger ran to the bedroom for pillows.  There was a
fire in the kitchen.  He poked it up, and put water to
boil.
</p>

<p>
"Where's her hot-water bottle?" he called.  Not
getting any answer he looked for it in one of the beds,
which had not yet been made up.  He filled the bottle
and made up the bed.  "Now, Charles," he said, "we
must get her into bed.  I wish your girl would bring
the doctor."
</p>

<p>
Charles looked at him stupidly.  "I believe she's
dying, Roger," he answered.  "O God, I believe she's
dying.  I've never seen any one like this.  She used to
be so pretty, Roger, before all this happened."
</p>

<p>
"Dying?  Nonsense!" said Roger.  He turned to
the patient.  "Kitty," he said, "we're going to put
you to bed.  Lean on my arm."
</p>

<p>
The laughter stopped; but the limbs crazily made
protest.  He had never seen anything like it.  It was
as though the charming graceful woman had suddenly
been filled by the spirit of a wild animal, which was
knocking itself to pieces against the corners in the
strange house.
</p>

<p>
"We shall have to carry her, Charles," he said.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," said Charles.  "She's dying."
</p>

<p>
The doctor, coming in abruptly, took the battle out
of his hands.  "Come, come," he said.  "Come,
Mrs. Pollock.  I was afraid that you were ill.  You'll feel a
lot better when you get to bed.  I want you to rest."
</p>

<p>
He turned to Pollock.  "Get her into bed," he said.
"Have you got a nurse?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Pollock.  "She can't come till July."
</p>

<p>
"Bessie here will do for the moment," said Roger.
</p>

<p>
Bessie and Pollock helped her to bed.  The doctor
and Roger talked desultorily.
</p>

<p>
"No.  It's nothing serious.  So the frame came
down and stunned him?  I see.  And she came in and
found him in the grate?  Yes.  A nasty shock.  Yes.
Yes.  Of course, it may be serious.  It will be impossible
to say till I see her.  If she had had other children
I should say not.  But&mdash;  Would you say that she
is an excitable woman, given to these attacks?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  She used to write a little.  She is nervous;
but not excitable.  Do you find that occupation has
much influence on the capacity to resist shock?"
</p>

<p>
"N-no," said the doctor.  "Resistance depends on
character.  Occupation only modifies character slightly.
Life being what it is, one has to be adaptable to survive."
</p>

<p>
Pollock entered, looking beaten.
</p>

<p>
"Will you come, doctor?" he said.
</p>

<p>
They went.
</p>

<p>
Presently Pollock returned alone.  He sat down.
</p>

<p>
"It's It," he said despondently.  "My picture's not
done.  I shan't have a penny till July.  We were
counting on its not happening till July.  I've not got
ten pounds."
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't worry about that," said Roger.
"You must borrow from me.  Take this cheque.  I'll
endorse it.  Give me yours for half of it.  Don't say
you won't.  Look here.  You must.  Now about a
nurse.  Look here.  Listen to me, Charles.  You can't
leave here.  I'll see about a nurse.  I know the sort of
woman Kitty would like.  I'll settle all that with the
doctor.  I'll send the best I can.  You can't leave
Kitty, that's certain."
</p>

<p>
Pollock pulled himself together.  The doctor
returned.  Roger took the addresses of several women,
and hurried off to interview them.  No cab was in
sight.  He wasted ten good minutes of nervous tension
in trying to find one.  He found one at last.  As he
drove, the desire to be at Ottalie's flat made him
forget his friend.  He thought only of the chance of
seeing Ottalie.  He must waste no time.  He wondered
if he would be too late, as in his dream.  He would
have to get there early, very early.  He prayed that
the first nurse on his list might be a suitable woman.
The image of the suitable nurse, a big, calm, placid,
ox-eyed woman, formed in his mind.  If he could find
her at once he would be in time.  He was longing to
be pounding past Whitehall, on the way to Shaftesbury
Avenue.  A clock above a hosier's told him that
it was nine.  No.  That clock had stopped.  Another
clock, further on, over a general store, said eight-fifteen.
Yet another, eight-thirty.  His watch said
eight-thirty-five; but his watch was fast.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Perks, of 7 Denning Street, was out.  Would he
leave a message?  No, he would not leave a message.
Was it Mrs. Ford?  No, not Mrs. Ford, another lady.
Perhaps he would come back.  He bade the cabman to
hurry.  Mrs. Stanton, the next on the list, could not
come.  She was expecting a call from another lady.
Mrs. Sanders was out, and "wouldn't be back all day,
she said."  The fourth, a brisk, level-headed woman,
busy at a sewing-machine in a neat room, would come;
but was he the husband, and could she be certain of her
fees, and what servants were kept?
</p>

<p>
He said that the fees were safe.  He gave her two
sovereigns on account.  Then she boggled at the single
servant.  She was not very strong.  She had never
before been with any lady with only one servant.  She
wasn't sure how she would get on.  She had herself to
consider.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," said Roger.  "You would have been
the very woman.  I'll go on to the hospital."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I could manage," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Will you come?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Is it in a house or a flat?"
</p>

<p>
"It's in a top flat."
</p>

<p>
"I dare say I could manage," she said, still hesitating.
</p>

<p>
Roger, remembering suddenly that Pollock had a
married sister, vowed that another lady would be there
a good deal in the daytime.  She weighed this fact as
she stood by the door of the cupboard about to take her
hat.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I should care to do it," she said
suddenly.  "I've not been used to that class of work."
</p>

<p>
Turning at the door as he went out, he saw that she
was watching him with a faint smile.  Only the
hospital remained.
</p>

<p>
It took him a long way out of his way.  It was
twenty past nine when he reached the hospital.  Very
soon it would be too late for Ottalie.  His heart sank.
He believed in telepathy.  He was thinking so fixedly
on Ottalie that he believed that she must sense his
thought.  "Ottalie, Ottalie," he kept saying to
himself.  "Wait for me.  Wait for me.  I shall come.  I
am coming as fast as I can.  Can't you feel me
hurrying to you?  Wait for me.  Don't let me miss you."  He
discharged his horse-cab, and engaged a motor-cab.
Two minutes later he had engaged a nurse.  She was
in the cab with him.  They were whirling south.
</p>

<p>
"No," she was telling him.  "I don't find much
difference in my cases.  I don't generally see them
after.  Some are more interesting than others.  I like
being with an interesting case.  I don't mean to say a
serious case, and have either of them die, and that.  I
mean, you know, out of the usual.  That's why I like
having to do with a first child."
</p>

<p>
She asked if there were any chance of her being too
late.  Roger, with his heart full of Ottalie, could not
tell her.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't like to be too late," she said.  "I've
never missed a case yet.  Never.  I should be vexed
if I were too late with this one.  It's a painter
gentleman, I think you said it was?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"I was with a painter's lady once before," she said.
"He gave me a little picture of myself."
</p>

<p>
They reached the flat.  Pollock's sister had arrived.
The doctor had sent his son for her.  Pollock was
moodily breaking chalk upon a drawing.  The studio
was foul with the smoke of cigarettes.  "I can't work,"
he said, lighting a cigarette from the fag-end of the last.
"Sit down."  He flung away his chalk and sat down.
"You've been awfully good to me, Roger.  You've got
me out of a tragedy.  You don't know what it feels like."
</p>

<p>
"How is Kitty?"
</p>

<p>
"Pretty well, the doctor thinks.  God knows what
he would call bad.  This is all new to me.  I don't
want to go through this again.  God knows if she'll ever
get through it.  I shall shoot myself if anything
happens to Kitty."
</p>

<p>
Roger glanced at his watch.  It was eighteen minutes
to ten.  He would have to fly to find Ottalie.  If
she were in town at all, she would be out by ten.  He
was sure of that.  His motor-cab was waiting.  He had
a quarter of an hour.  But how could he leave Pollock
in this state?
</p>

<p>
"Charles," he said, "I want you to come out with
me.  You've got on shoes, I see.  Take your hat.
Kitty is with three capable women and a doctor.
You're only in the way, and making a fuss.  Come
with me.  I'll leave you at the National Gallery, while
I see a friend.  Then we'll go to Bondini's, in Suffolk
Street."  He called gently to Pollock's sister.
"Mrs. Fane," he said, "I'm taking Charles to Bondini's, in
Suffolk Street."
</p>

<p>
"A very good thing," said Mrs. Fane.  "A man is
much better out of the way in times like these."
</p>

<p>
They started.  Just outside Dean's Yard Gate the
cab broke down.  Roger got out.  "What's the
matter?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing much, sir," said the man, already busy
under the bonnet.  "I won't keep you a minute.  Get
in again, sir."
</p>

<p>
A hand touched Roger's arm.  He turned.  A total
stranger, unmistakably a journalist, was at his side.
Roger shuddered.  It was an interviewer from <i>The
Meridian</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Naldrett?" said the interviewer, taking a long
shot.  "I recognised you by your portrait in <i>The
Bibliophile</i>.  A lucky meeting.  Perhaps you didn't get
my telegram.  I called round at your rooms just now,
but you were out.  I want to ask you about your play
<i>The Matron</i>.  It attracted considerable attention.
Will you please tell me if you have any particular ideas
about tragedy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Roger; "I have.  And I'm going to
express them.  I'm in a great hurry; and I must refuse
to be interviewed.  Please thank your editor from me
for the honour he has done me; but tell him that I
cannot be interviewed."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not, since you wish it," said the journalist.
"But I would like to ask you one thing.  I am
told your play is very morbid.  Are you morbid?
You don't look very morbid."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry," said Roger.  "But I am not morbid."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Naldrett," said the journalist, "are you going
to write any more tragedies like <i>The Roman Matron</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"I have one finished and one half finished," said
Roger.
</p>

<p>
"I hope, Mr. Naldrett," said the journalist, "that
you have written them for ordinary people, as well as
to please yourself.  Writing to please one's self is very
artistic.  But won't you consider Clapham, and
Balham, and Tooting?  How will you please them with
tragedies?  A good comedy is what people like.  They
want something to laugh at, after their day's work.
They're quite right.  A good comedy's the thing.
Anybody can write a tragedy.  What's the good of
making people gloomy?  One wants the pleasant things of
life, Mr. Naldrett, on the stage.  One goes to the
theatre to be amused.  There's enough tragedy in real life
without one getting more in the theatre.  I suppose
you've studied Ibsen, Mr. Naldrett?"
</p>

<p>
"Have not you?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe in him.  He may be a thinker and
all that, but his view of life is very morbid.  He is a
decadent.  Of course, they say his technique is very
fine.  But he has a mind like a sewer."
</p>

<p>
"Quite ready, sir," said the chauffeur, swinging
himself into his seat.
</p>

<p>
"I must wish you good-bye, here," said Roger to the
interviewer.  "Mind your coat.  It's caught in the
door.  Mind you thank your editor."  The cab snorted
off, honking.  The interviewer gazed after it.  "H'm,"
he said, with that little cynical nod with which the
unintelligent express comprehension.  "So that's the new
drama, is it?"
</p>

<p>
The car reached Trafalgar Square without being
stopped by the traffic.  St. Martin's clock stood at a
few minutes to ten.  Roger was in the dismal mood of
one who, having given up hope, is yet not certain.  He
dropped Pollock at the Gallery, and then sped on,
through Leicester Square, up a little street full of
restaurants and French book shops.  The car was stopped
by traffic at the end of this street.  Roger leapt out,
paid the man hurriedly, and ran into the Avenue.
Within thirty seconds, he was running up four flights
of stairs to the door on which he had knocked in his
vision.
</p>

<p>
He peered through the glass in the door.  As in his
dream, something lay in the passage beyond, some glove
or handkerchief or crumpled letter, with a shaft of
sunlight upon it from an open door.  No one came to
open to him; but Roger, knocking there, was conscious
of the presence of Ottalie by him and in him; he felt
her brushing past him, a rustling, breathing beauty,
wearing a great hat, and those old pearl earrings which
trembled when she turned her head.  But no Ottalie
came to the door, no Agatha, no old Mrs. Hicks the
caretaker.  The flat was empty.  After a couple of minutes
of knocking, an old, untidy, red-faced woman came out
from the flat beneath, gasping for breath, with her
hand against her side.
</p>

<p>
"No use your knockin'," she said crustily.
"They're gawn awy.  They i'n't 'ere.  They're gawn
awy."
</p>

<p>
"When did they go?" asked Roger, filled suddenly
with leaping fire.
</p>

<p>
"They're gawn awy," repeated the old woman.
"No use your knockin'.  They're gawn awy."  She
gasped for a moment, eyeing Roger with suspicion and
dislike; then turned to her home with the slow,
uncertain, fumbling movements of one whose heart is
affected.
</p>

<p>
Roger was left alone on the stairs, aware that he had
come too late.
</p>

<p>
The stairs were covered with a layer of sheet-lead.
When the old woman had shut her door, Roger grovelled
down upon them, lighting match after match, in the
hope of finding footmarks which might tell him more.
Agatha had rather long feet, Ottalie's were small, but
very well proportioned.  Mrs. Hicks's feet were
disguised by the boots she wore.  A scrap of brown
linoleum on the stair-head bore evident marks of a man's
hobnail boots which had waited there, perhaps for an
answer.  There were other, non-committal marks,
which might have been made by anybody.  On the
whole, Roger fancied that a woman had made them,
when going out, with dry shoes, that morning.  The
problem now was, had she left London for Ireland or
for the Continent?  With some misgivings, he decided
against Ireland.  On former occasions she had always
made her stay in London after her visit to the
Continent.  If she had been staying in London for more
than one night, she would have written to him; he
would have seen her.  As she had not written to him,
she was plainly going abroad, probably for a month
or six weeks, after resting for one night on the way.
He would not see her till the middle of the summer.
That she had been in town, for at least one night, was
plain from what the woman had said.  The thought
that only a few hours ago she had passed where he
stood, came home to him like her touch upon him.  He
sat down upon the stair-head till his disappointment was
mastered.
</p>

<p>
He took a last look through the door-glass at the
crumpled thing, glove, letter, or handkerchief, lying in
the passage.  Then he went out into the avenue.  The
disappointment was very bitter to him.  It was so
strong an emphasis upon the prophetic quality of his
dream.  Ottalie had been there, waiting for him.  He
had come there too late.  He had missed her.  The
thought that he had missed her, suggested the cause.
He would have to go back to Pollock.  He could not
leave his friend alone in that wild state of mind.  A
smaller man would perhaps have felt resentment against
the cause.  Roger was without that littleness.  He saw
only the tragic irony.  He saw life being played upon a
great plan.  He felt himself to be a fine piece set aside
from his own combination by one greater, stronger,
more wonderful.  It seemed very wonderful that he
had been kept (so unexpectedly) from Ottalie, by the
one thing in the world strong enough so to keep him.
Nothing but a matter of life and death could have kept
him from her.
</p>

<p>
A lively desire sprang up in him to know whither
she had gone.  This (he thought) he could find out,
without difficulty, from a Bradshaw.  If she were
going to Greece, she would go by one of two ways.  For
a few minutes he had the hope that she might not yet
have left London, that he might catch her at the station.
A Bradshaw showed him that this was possible, since,
going by one route, she would not have to start till
after seven in the evening.  But, if she had chosen that
route, why should she have closed the flat so early?
He saw no answer to the question.  Still, the
uncertainty preyed upon him and flattered him at the same
time.  She might be there at seven.  He would go to
the station, in any case.  Would it were seven!  He
had nine hours to live through.
</p>

<p>
He walked hurriedly to the National Gallery.  He
remembered, when he entered, that he had made no
rendezvous with Pollock.  He expected to find him
before the <i>Ariadne</i>.  He was not there.  He was not
before his other favourite, <i>The Return of Ulysses</i>.  He
was not in any of the little rooms opening off the Italian
rooms.  A hurried walk round all the foreign schools
showed that Pollock was not in that part of the Gallery
at all.  Very few people were in the Gallery at that
hour.  There could be no mistake.  He tried the
English rooms, without success.  He described Pollock to
the keepers of the lower stairs.  "No, sir.  No one's
gone down like that."  Search in the basement, in the
little rooms where the Turner water-colours and
Arundel prints are kept, showed him that Pollock was not in
the Gallery.  He wished to be quite certain.  He made
a swift beat of the French and Spanish rooms, and
thence, by the Dutch and Flemish schools, to the Italian
rooms.  Here he doubled back upon his tracks, to avoid
all possibility of mistake.  He was now certain Pollock
was not in the Gallery.  Very probably he had never
entered it.  What had become of him?
</p>

<p>
He could hardly have gone to the Portrait Gallery,
he thought.  Yet it was possible.  Pollock was in an
excited state of mind.  He was hardly in a fit state to
be out alone.  Roger felt anxious.  He hurried to the
Portrait Gallery.  After a long search, upstairs and
downstairs, in those avenues of painted eyes, he decided
that Pollock was not there, either.  He must have gone
to Bondini's.  Suffolk Street was only a quarter of a
mile away.  Roger hurried on to look for him at
Bondini's.  But no.  He was not at Bondini's.  Where,
then, could he be?
</p>

<p>
By this time, Roger was alarmed for his friend.  He
thought that something must have happened to Kitty.
He took a cab to Vincent Square to make sure.
Pollock let him in.  He was smoking a cigarette.  His
bandage gave him a one-eyed look, infinitely depressing.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, Roger," he said; "I couldn't keep away
from Kitty.  She's quieter, but no better.  O God,
Roger, I don't know how men can be unkind to women.
I don't know what I shall do without her, if anything
happens to her."
</p>

<p>
"You must not lose heart, like this," Roger said.
"I understand, very well, what you are feeling.  But
you ought not to expect evil in this way.  Very, very
few cases go wrong, now.  I was afraid that something
had happened to you.  Will you come to my rooms
for a game of chess?  Then we could lunch together,
and go on, perhaps, to Henderson's.  He has finished
the picture he was working on."
</p>

<p>
Pollock was not to be tempted.  He would not leave
Kitty.  After talking with him for nearly an hour,
Roger left him, promising to come back before long, to
enquire.
</p>

<p>
When he got outside, into the street, with no definite,
immediate object to occupy his mind, he was assailed
by the memories of his succession of mishaps.  He
could not say that one of them hurt more than another.
The loss of Ottalie, following so swiftly on the dream,
made him miserable.  The destruction of his play by
the critics made him feel not exactly guilty, but unclean,
as though the rabble had spat upon him.  He felt
"unclean," in the Levitical sense.  He had some
hesitation in going to mix with his fellows.
</p>

<p>
He kept saying to himself that if he were not very
careful, the world would be flooding into his mind,
trampling its garden to mud.  It was his duty to beat
back the world before it fouled his inner vision.  If he
were not very careful he would find that his next work
would be tainted with some feverish animosity, some
personal bitterness, or weakness of contempt.  It was
his duty as a man and as an artist to prevent that, so
that his mind might be as a hedged garden full of
flowers, or as a clear, unflawed mirror, reflecting only
perfect images.  The events of the night before had
broken in his barriers.  He felt that his old theory, laid
aside long before, when he first felt the fascination of
modern artistic methods, was true, after all; that the
right pursuit of the artist was the practice of Christianity.
He found in the National Gallery, in the battle
picture of Uccello, in the nobleness of that young
knight, riding calmly among the spears, a healing image
of the artist.  He lingered before that divine young
man with the fair hair until one o'clock.  He passed
the afternoon at a table in the British Museum, reading
all that he could find about Ottalie.  There was her
name in full in the Irish Landed Gentry.  There were
the names of all her relatives, and the names of their
houses.  It was an absurd thing to read these entries,
but the names were all stimulants to memory.  He
knew these people and places.  They took vivid shape
in his mind as he read them.  He had read them
before, more than once, when the craving for her had
been bitter in the past.  He knew the names of her
forebears unto the third and fourth generation.  A
volume of <i>Who's Who</i> gave him details of her living
relatives.  A married uncle's recreations were "shooting
and hunting."  A maiden aunt had published <i>Songs
of Quiet Life</i>, in 1902.  Her older brother, Leslie
Fawcett, had published a novel, <i>One Summer</i>, in 1891.
Both these volumes lay beside him.  He read them
again, for the tenth time.  Both were very short
works; and both, he felt, helped him to understand
Ottalie.  Neither work was profound; but both came
from a sweet and noble nature, at once charming and
firm.  There were passages in the songs which were
like Ottalie's inner nature speaking.  In the novel, in
the chapter on a girl, he thought that he recognised
Ottalie as she must have been long ago.
</p>

<p>
The volume of the Landed Gentry gave him pity for
the historian who would come a century hence, to grub
up facts for his history.  Ottalie, dear, breathing,
beautiful woman, witty, and lovely-haired, and noble like a
lady in a poem, would be to such a one "3rd dau.,"
or, perhaps, mere "issue."
</p>

<p>
At five o'clock, he put away his books.  He went to
drink tea at a dairy, in High Holborn.  He entered the
place with some misgivings, for his two emotions made
the world distasteful to him.  The memory of the
night before made him feel that he had been whipped
in public.  The thought of Ottalie made him feel that
the real world was in his brain.  He shrank from
meeting anybody known to him.  That old feeling of
"uncleanness" came strongly over him.  The stuffy
unquiet of the Museum had at least been filled by
preoccupied, selfish people.  Here in the tea-shop, everybody
stared.  All the little uncomfortable tables were
peopled by pairs of eyes.  He felt that a woman giggled,
that a young man nudged his fellow.  Stepping back
to let a waitress pass, he knocked over a chair.  The
place was cramped; he felt stupidly awkward and
uncomfortable.  He blushed as he picked up the chair.
Everybody stared.  It seemed to him that they were
saying, "That is Mr. Naldrett, the author of the piece
which was booed off last night.  They say it's very
immoral.  Millie was there.  She said it was a silly lot
of old-fashioned stuff.  What funny eyes he's got.
And look at the way he puts his feet."
</p>

<p>
He sat down in a corner, from which he could survey
the room.  A paper lay upon the table; he picked it up
abstractedly.  It was a copy of <i>The Post Meridian</i>.
Somebody had rested butter upon the upper part of it.
He glanced at it for an instant, just long enough to see
a leading article below the grease mark.  "Drama and
Decency," ran the scarehead.  It went on to say that
the London public had once again shown its unerring
sense of the fitness of things over Mr. Naldrett's play.
He dropped the paper to one side, and wiped the hand
which had touched it.  He felt beaten to bay.  He
stared forward at the house so fiercely that a timid lady,
of middle age and ill-health, possibly as beaten as
himself, turned from the chair opposite before she sat down.
There were no friends of his there, except a red-haired,
fierce little poet, who sat close by, reading and
eating cake.  The yellow back of <i>Les Fleurs du Mal</i>
was propped against his teapot.  He bit so fiercely
that his beard wagged at each bite.  Something of the
fierceness and passion of the <i>Femmes Damnées</i>, or of
<i>le vin de l'Assassin</i>, was wreaked upon the cake.  There
came a muttering among the bites.  The man was
almost reading aloud.  A memory of Baudelaire came to
Roger, a few grand melancholy lines:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "La servante au grand coeur dont vous étiez jalouse,<br />
  Et qui dort sans sommeil sous une humble pelouse,<br />
  Nous devrions pourtant lui porter quelques fleurs.<br />
  Les morts, les pauvres morts, ont de grandes douleurs,<br />
  Et quand Octobre souffle, émondeur des vieux arbres,<br />
  Son vent mélancolique à l'entour de leurs marbres,<br />
  Certe, ils doivent trouver les vivants bien ingrats."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He wondered if it would be like that.  A waitress
brought him tea and toast.  He poured a little tea
into his cup, thinking of a man now dead, who had
drunk tea there with him a year ago.  One was very
callous about the dead.  He wondered if the dead were
callous about the living, or whether they had of <i>grandes
douleurs</i>, as the poet thought.  He felt that he would
not mind being dead, but for Ottalie.  He wondered
whether Ottalie had read the papers.  He buttered
some toast and laid it to one side of his plate, a sort
of burnt offering to the dead.  A line on the bill of
fare caught his eye.  "Pan-Bos.  Our new Health
Bread.  Per Portion, 2d."  His tired mind turned it
backwards, ".d2 ,noitroP reP daerB."  "I am going
mad," he said to himself.  "Shall I go to Ireland
to-night?"
</p>

<p>
Something warned him that if he went to Ireland,
Ottalie would not be there.  With Ottalie away, it
would be intolerable.  There would be her house, up
on the hills, and all those sycamores, like ghosts in the
twilight, ghosts of old men brooding on her beauty, like
the old men in Troy when Helen passed.  No.  He
could not bear Ireland with her away.  He thought of
the boat train with regret for the old jolly jaunts.
The guard with a Scotch accent, the carriage in front
which went on to Dundee, the sound of the beautiful
Irish voice ("voce assai più che la nostra viva"), and
then the hiring of rug and pillow, knowing that one
would wake in Scotland, among hills, running water, a
"stately speech," and pure air.  It would not be wise
to go to Ireland.  If he went now, with Ottalie away,
he might not be able to go later, when she would be
there.  It would be nothing without her.  Nothing but
lonely reading, writing, walking, and swimming.  It
would be better not to go.  Here the poet gulped his
cake, rose, and advanced on Roger.
</p>

<p>
"How d'you do?" he said, speaking rapidly, as
though his words were playing tag.  "I've just been
talking to Collins about you.  He's been telling me
about your play.  I hear you had a row, or something."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  There was a row."
</p>

<p>
"Collins has been going for you in <i>The Daystar</i>.
He says you haven't read Aristotle, or something.
Have you seen his article?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I haven't seen it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you ought to read it.  Parts of it are very
witty.  It would cheer you up."
</p>

<p>
"What does he say?"
</p>

<p>
"He says that&mdash;  Oh, you know what Collins says.
He says that you&mdash;  I believe I've got it on me.  I cut
it out.  Where did I put it?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind.  I'm not interested in Collins."
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you?  He's very good.  I suppose your
play'll be produced again later?"
</p>

<p>
"I think not."
</p>

<p>
He got rid of the poet, paid his bill, and walked out.
Outside he ran into Hollins, the critic of <i>The Week</i>.
He would have avoided Hollins, but Hollins stopped
him.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Naldrett," he said.  "I've just been going for
you in <i>The Week</i>.  What do you mean by that third
act?  Really.  It really was&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
It gave Roger a kind of awe to think that this man
had been damning other people's acts before he was
born.
</p>

<p>
"What was wrong with the third act?  You didn't
hear it."
</p>

<p>
"You must read M. Capus," said Hollins, passing
on.  "I shall go for you until you do."
</p>

<p>
A newsboy, with a voice like a bird of doom, flying
in the night, held a coloured bill.  "Drama and
Decency," ran the big letters.  Another, offering a copy,
shewed, as allurement, "<i>'ceful Fracas</i>."  The whole
town seemed angry with him.  He crossed into Seven
Dials, and along to St. Martin's Lane, where he knew
of a quiet reading-room.  Here he hid.

  There's hope left yet.<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At seven o'clock he went to the station, hoping
(against his better judgment) that he might
see Ottalie at the train.  The train was very
crowded.  The travellers wore the pleased, expectant
look with which one leaves an English city.  Ottalie
was not among them.  He went down the train twice,
in opposite directions, without success.  She was not
there.  She must have started that morning.  He had
missed her.
</p>

<p>
He sat down on one of the station benches.  His
world seemed slipping from him.  He told himself that
to-morrow he would have to work, or all these worries
would destroy him.  He felt more lonely than he had
ever felt in his life.  A week before, he would have had
O'Neill, Pollock, and another friend, now abroad.
O'Neill was gone, without a farewell.  Pollock was
fighting his own battles, with poor success.  Ottalie was
thundering across France, or, perhaps, just drawing
into Paris.
</p>

<p>
A longing to see some one drove him out of the
station.  He walked to Soho, to a Spanish restaurant,
where some of his friends sometimes dined.
</p>

<p>
Here, at night, the curious may visit Spain, and hear
the guttural, lisping speech, and munch upon chuletas,
and swallow all manner of strangeness in cazuelas.
Very bold young men cry aloud there for "Mozo,"
lisping the z.  The less bold signal with the hand.  The
timid point, and later, eat that which is set before them,
asking no question, obeying Holy Writ, though without
spiritual profit.
</p>

<p>
On entering the place, he bowed to the Scotch-looking,
heavily-earringed Spanish woman, who sat at the
desk reading <i>Blanco y Negro</i>.  She gave him a
"Buenas tardes," without lifting her eyes.  Then came,
from his right, a cry of "Naldrett!"
</p>

<p>
Two painters, a poet, and proportionable woman-kind,
were dining together there, over the evening
papers.
</p>

<p>
"How are you?" said one of the painters.
</p>

<p>
"We've just been reading about you," said the other.
</p>

<p>
"Reading the most terrible things," said the poet.
</p>

<p>
"Shew him <i>The Orb</i>.  <i>The Orb's</i> the best."
</p>

<p>
"No.  Shew him <i>The Planet</i>.  The one who says he
ought to be prosecuted."
</p>

<p>
Roger, refusing <i>Orb</i> and <i>Planet</i>, shook hands with
one of the ladies.  She was a little actress, delicate,
fragile, almost inhuman, with charm in all she did.
She said that she had been reading his book of <i>The
Handful</i>, and had found it very "interesting."  She
wanted Roger to come to tea, to talk over a scheme of
hers.  It dawned on Roger that she was saving him
from his friends.
</p>

<p>
"You're the man of the moment," said the poet.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you pay any attention to any of them," said
the painter who had first spoken.  "You may be quite
sure that when one has to say a thing in a hurry, as
these critics must, one says the easiest thing, and the
thing which comes handiest to say.  If I paid attention
to all they say about me I should be in a lunatic
asylum.  Besides, what does it matter what they say?
Who are they, when all is said?"
</p>

<p>
The talk drifted into a wit combat, in which the seven
set themselves to define a critic with the greatest
possible pungency and precision.  Having done this, to their
own satisfaction, they set themselves to the making of a
composite sonnet on the critic, upon the backs of bills
of fare.  One of the painters drew an ideal critic, in
the manners, now of Tintoret, now of Velasquez, now
of Watteau.  The other, who complained that old masters
ought to be ranked with critics, because they spoiled
the market for living painters, drew him in the manner
of Rops.
</p>

<p>
After dinner, Roger walked home by a roundabout
road, which took him past his theatre.  A few people
hung about outside it, staring idly at a few others who
were entering.  His play was still running, it seemed,
in spite of the trouble.  Falempin was brave.
</p>

<p>
He walked back to his rooms, wondering why he had
not gone to Ireland that night.  London oppressed and
pained him.  He thought it an ugly city, full of ugly
life.  He was without any desire to be a citizen of such
a city.  He disliked the place and her people; but
to-night, being, perhaps, a little humbled by his
misfortunes, he found himself wondering whether all the
squalor of the town, its beastly drinking dens, its mobs
of brainless, inquisitive shouters, might not be changed
suddenly to beauty and noble life by some sudden general
inspiration, such as comes to nations at rare times
under suffering.  He decided against it.  Patience
under suffering was hardly one of our traits.
</p>

<p>
On his sitting-room table was a letter from Ottalie,
bearing the London post-mark across the Greek stamps,
and underneath them the legend, "2d. to pay."  By
the date on the letter it had been ten days in getting to
him.  He opened it eagerly, half expecting to find in it
the very letter of the dream, though something told him
that the dream-letters had contained her essential
thoughts, the letter in his hand the worldly covering of
those thoughts, translated into earthly speech with its
reservations and half-heartedness.  He learned from
this letter that she had been for a month in Greece,
and was now coming home.  She would be for four
days, from the 7th to the 11th, at her flat in London.
She hoped to see him there, before she returned to
Ireland.  To his amazement the postscript ran: "I have
read your last book.  It reads like the diary of a lost
soul," the very words seen by him in dream.  For the
moment this did not move him so deeply as the thought
that this was the 11th of the month.  She had been
in London with him for the last three or four days,
and he had never known it.  He had seen her light
blown out the night before.  If he had had a little
sense he would have called on her early that
morning before he had breakfasted.  Had he done so, he
would have seen her, he would have driven with her
to the station, he could, perhaps, have travelled with her
to Ireland.  The bitterness of his disappointment made
him think, for a moment, meanly of Agatha, who, in his
fancy, had kept them apart.  He suspected that Agatha
had held back the letter.  How else could it have been
posted in London with Greek stamps upon it?
</p>

<p>
Then came the thought that she had not gone to
Ireland that morning.  He had never known her go back
to Ireland by the day-boats.  She liked to sleep in the
train, and save the daylight for life.  His knowledge
of her told him what had happened.  She had taken
her luggage to the station, soon after breakfast.
Having done this, she had passed the day in amusement,
dined at the station hotel, and now&mdash;
</p>

<p>
He sat down, beaten by this last disappointment.
Now she was steaming north in the night express to
Port Patrick.  She had only just gone.  She was
within a dozen miles of him.  The train did not start
till eight.  It was now only fourteen minutes past.  If
he had not been a fool; if he had only come home
instead of going to the station!
</p>

<p>
"Selina," he cried down to the basement, "when did
this letter come?  This letter with the foreign stamp."
</p>

<p>
"Just after you'd gone out this morning, sir."
</p>

<p>
Five minutes' patience would have altered his life.
</p>

<p>
"A lady come to see you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What was her name?"
</p>

<p>
"She didn't leave a name, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What was she like?  When did she come?"
</p>

<p>
"She came about a few minutes before nine, sir.
She seemed very put out at not finding you."
</p>

<p>
"Had she been here before?"
</p>

<p>
"I think she was the lady come here one time with
another lady, a dark lady, when you 'ad the suite
upstairs, sir.  I think she come in one evenin' when you
read to them."
</p>

<p>
Ottalie had been there.  It must have been Ottalie.
</p>

<p>
"I told her you was gone awy, sir.  You 'adn't said
where to."
</p>

<p>
He thanked Selina.  He bit his lips lest he should
ask whether the visitor had worn earrings.  He went
back into his room and sat down.  He had not realised
till then how much Ottalie meant to him.  A voice rang
in his brain that he had missed her, missed her by a
few minutes, through his own impatience, through some
chance, through some juggling against him of the
powers outside life.  All his misery seemed rolled into a
leaden ball, which was smashing through his brain.
The play was a little thing.  The loss of John was a
little thing.  Templeton was farcical, the critics were
little gnats, but to have missed Ottalie, to have lost
Ottalie!  He tasted a moment of despair.
</p>

<p>
Despair does not last long.  It kills, or it goads to
action.  With Roger it lasted for a few seconds, and
then changed to a passion to be on the way to her.
But he would have to wait, he would have to wait.
There were all those interminable hours to wait.  All a
whole night of purgatory.  What could he do
meanwhile?  How could he pass that night?  What could
he do?  Work was impossible.  Talk was impossible.
He remembered then, another thing.
</p>

<p>
He opened his Bradshaw feverishly.  Yes.  There
was another boat-train to Holyhead.  He could be in
Dublin a little after dawn the next day; "8.45 from
Euston."  He could just do it.  He would catch that
second boat-train.  It was a bare chance; but it could
be done.  He could be with Ottalie by the afternoon of
the next day.  But money; he had not enough money.
Five minutes to pack.  He could spare that; but how
about money?  To whom could he go for money?
Who would have money to lend upon the instant?  It
would have to be some one near at hand.  Every second
made his task harder.  Where would there be a cab?
Which of his friends lived on the way to Euston?
Who lives between Westminster and Euston?  It is all
park, and slum, and boarding-house.  Big Ben, lifting
his voice, intoned the quarter.
</p>

<p>
He caught a cab outside Dean's Yard.  He drove to
a friend in Thames Chambers.  The friend lent him a
sovereign and some loose silver.  He had enough now
to take him to Ireland.  He bade the cabman to hurry.
The newsboys were busy in the Strand.  They were
calling out something about winner, and disaster.  He
saw one newsbill flutter out from a man's hand.
"British Liner Lost," ran the heading.  He felt
relieved that the monkey-mind had now something new to
occupy it.  The changing of the newsbill heading made
him feel cleaner.
</p>

<p>
Up to the crossing of Holborn, he felt that he would
catch the train.  At Holborn the way was barred by
traffic.  The Euston Road was also barred to him.  He
missed the train by rather more than a minute.  He
was too tired to feel more disappointment.  The best
thing for him to do, he thought, would be to sleep at
home, catch the boat-train in the morning and travel
all day.  That plan would land him in Ireland within
twenty-four hours.  He could then either stay a night
in port, or post the forty miles to his cottage.  In any
case he would be with Ottalie, actually in her very
presence, within forty hours.  By posting the forty miles
he might watch the next night outside her window, in
the deep peace of the Irish country, almost within sound
of the sea.  The thought of the great stars sweeping
over Ottalie's home, and of the moon coming up, filling
the valley, and of the little wind which trembled the
leaves, giving, as it were, speech to the beauty of the
night, moved him intensely.  In his overwrought mood,
these things were the only real things.  The rest was
all nightmare.
</p>

<p>
Driving back from Euston, he noticed another affiche,
bearing the words, "Steamer Sunk.  Lives Lost."  He
paid no attention to it.  He wondered vaguely, as he
had often wondered in the past, what kind of a mind
browsed upon these things.  A disaster, an attack upon
the Government, and a column of betting news.  That
was what God's image brooded upon, night after night.
That was what God's image wrote about nightly, after
an expensive education.
</p>

<p>
He was very tired; but there could be no rest for him
till he had enquired after Mrs. Pollock.  She had given
birth to a little girl, who was likely to live.  She
herself was very weak, but not in serious danger.  Pollock
was making good resolutions in a mist of cigarette
smoke.  Roger was not wanted there.  He went home,
to bed, tired out.  He slept heavily.
</p>

<p>
He was fresh and merry the next morning.  He
packed at leisure, breakfasted at ease, and drove away
to the station, feeling like a boy upon a holiday.  He
was leaving this grimy, gritty wilderness.  He was
going to forget all about it.  In a few hours he would be
over the border, in a new land.  That night he would
be over the sea, so changed, and in a land so different,
that all this would seem like a horrid, far-away dream,
indescribably squalid and useless.  London was a
strong, poisonous drug, to be taken in minute doses.
He was going to take a strong corrective.
</p>

<p>
The train journey was long and slow; but after Carlisle
was passed, his mind began to feel the excitement
of it.  In a couple of hours he would be in a steamer,
standing well forward, watching for the double lights to
flash, and the third light, farther to the south, to blink
and gleam.  The dull, low, Scottish landscape, where
Burns lived and Keats tramped, gave way to irregular
low hills, indescribably lonely, with boggy lowland
beneath them and forlorn pools.  He looked out for one
such pool.  He had often noticed it before, on his
journeys that way.  It was a familiar landmark to him.
Like all the rest of that Scottish land, it was associated
in his mind with Ottalie.  All the journey was associated
with her.  He had travelled past those hills and
pools so often, only to see her, that they had become a
sort of ritual to him, a part of seeing her, something
which inevitably led to her.  After the hill with the
cairn, he saw his landmark.  There glittered the pool
under the last of the sun.  The little lonely island, not
big enough for a peel, but big enough, years ago, for a
lake-dwelling, shone out in a glimmer of withered
grass.  A few bents, bristling the shallows, bowed and
bowed and bowed as the wind blew.  A reef of black
rocks glided out at the pool's end, like an eel swimming.
Roger again had the fancy, which had risen in his
mind before a dozen times, when passing the pool, that
he would like to be a boy there, with a toy boat.
Another landmark tenderly looked for, was a little white
house rather far from the line, high up on the moor.
He had once thought (in passing) that that would be
a pleasant place for a week's stay when he and Ottalie
were married.  The tenderness of the original fancy
lingered still.  It had become an inevitable part of the
journey.  After a few minutes of looking, it came into
view, newly whitewashed, or, it may be, merely very
bright in the sunset.  A woman stood at a little
garden gate.  He had seen her there once before.
Perhaps she looked out for this evening train.  It might be
an event in her life.  She must be very lonely there,
so many miles from anywhere.  After this, he saw
only one more landmark, a copse of spruce-fir by the
line.  A faint mist was gathering.  There was going to
be a fog.  The boat would make a slow passage.
</p>

<p>
The mist was dim over everything when the train
stopped.  He got out on to a platform which was wet
with mist.  Wet milk-cans gleamed.  Rails shone
below his feet.  A bulk of a mail-train rose up, vacant
and dim.  People shouted and passed.  There was a
hot whiff of ship's engine.  A man passed, with nervous
hurry, carrying two teacups from the refreshment-room.
Somebody cried out to come along with the
mails.  An Irish voice answered excitedly, with a witty
bitterness which defined the owner to Roger, in vivid
outline.  Mist came driving down under the shed.  A
few moist steps took him to a rail of chains, beyond
which was motionless sea, a dim, grey-brown under the
mist, with a gull or two drifting and falling.  A row
of lights dimly dying away beyond, shewed him the
steamer.  The gangway slanted down, dripping wet
from the handrail.  A man was saying that "Indeed, it
was," in the curt, charming accent of the hills.
</p>

<p>
He did not recognise the steamer.  Her name, seen
upon a life-belt, was new to him.  He did not remember
a <i>Lady of Lyons</i> on this line.  He laid his bag in a
corner of the saloon, where already timid ladies were
preparing for the worst, by lying down, under rugs,
with bottles of salts at hand.  The smell of the saloon,
the smells of disinfectant, oil, rubber, and food, mixed
with the sickliness of a place half aired and
overheated, drove him on deck again.  An elderly man was
telling his wife that it had been a terrible business.
The lady answered with the hope that nothing would
happen to them, for what would poor Eddie do?
</p>

<p>
Somebody near the gangway, a hills-man by his
speech, probably the ticket-collector, or mate, was
speaking in the intervals of work.  He was checking the
slinging-in of crates, and talking to an acquaintance.
Roger had no wish to hear him.  He was impatient for
the ship to start.  But sitting down there, wrapped in
his mackintosh, he could not help overhearing odds and
ends of a story among the clack of the winches.
Something terrible had happened, and Tom would know
about it, and, indeed, it was a sad thing for the widow
O'Hara; but it was a quick death, anyway, and might
come on any man, for the matter of that.  Indeed, it
was a quick death, and the fault lay in these fogs, which
never gave a man a chance till she was right on top of
you.  What use were sidelights, when a fog might make
a headlight as red as blood?  She had come right into
her, just abaft the bridge, and cut her clean down.
They never saw a stim of her.  She wasn't even
sounding her horn.  Yes.  One of these big five-masted
Yankee schooners.  The <i>John P. Graves</i>.  Just out of
Glasgow.  They hadn't even a look-out set.  Taking
her chance.  Her crowd was drunk.  And one of the
dead was an English wumman only married that
morning.  No.  The man was saved.  Like a stunned man.
The most of the bodies was ashore to the wast of the
light.  There was a fierce jobble wast of the light.
</p>

<p>
There had been a collision somewhere.  There were
always being collisions.  Roger listened, and ceased to
listen, thinking of that "Steamer Sunk, Lives Lost"
on the London placard.  He thought that these vivid,
picturesque talkers, professional men; but full of
feeling, gave such an event a kind of poetry, and made it a
part of their lives, while the paper-reader, very far
away in the city, glanced at it, among a dozen similar
events, none of them closely brought home to him, or,
indeed, to be understood by him, and dismissed the
matter with an indifferent "Really.  How ghastly!"  He
reproved himself for thinking thus.  This collision
had affected the men near him in their daily business.
Londoners were affected by disasters which touched
themselves.  This disaster, whatever it was, did not
touch him.  He was in a contrary, bitter mood, too
much occupied with himself to feel for others.  He was
thinking that the men who did most were self-centred
men, shut away from the world without.  A snail,
suddenly stung on the tender horn, may think similarly.
</p>

<p>
It was dark night, but clear enough, when they
reached Ireland.  The lights in the bay shone as
before.  The lights on the island had not changed.  One,
high up, which he had often noticed, was as like a
star as ever.  Little glimmers of light danced before
him, as he dined in the hotel, attended by a grave old
waiter.  The hotel was fuller than usual at that time
of year.  It was full of restless, anxious, sad-looking
people, some of whom had been with him in the boat.
They gave him the fancy that they had all come over
for a funeral.  After supping, he went hurriedly to bed.
</p>

<p>
In the morning, at breakfast, there were the same
sad-looking people.  They sat at the next table, talking
in subdued voices, drinking tea.  They were breakfasting
on tea.  An old woman with that hard, commercial
face, assumed by predatory natures without energy,
mothered the party.  Her red eyes, swollen by weeping,
emphasised the vulpine in her.  A late-comer rustled
up.  "Alice won't come down," she said.  "She'll
have some tea upstairs."
</p>

<p>
The old woman, calling a maid, sent tea to Alice.  A
pale girl, daughter to the matron in all but spirit,
snuffled on the perilous brink, worn out by grief and
weariness.  The old woman rebuked her.  "We shall
have to be starting in a minute."  She had that
cast-iron nature limited to itself.  Roger wondered whether
in old Rome, or Puritan England, that kind of character
had been consciously bred in the race.  He changed his
table.
</p>

<p>
The waiter brought him a newspaper.  He fingered
it, and left it untouched.  He was not going to open a
paper till he could be sure that the uproar about him had
been forgotten.  He was a timorous, hunted hart.  The
hounds should not follow him into this retreat.  He
debated as he ate, whether he should bicycle, take the
"long car," a forty-mile drive, or take train.  Finally,
seeing that the roads were dry, and the wind not bad,
he decided to ride, sending his baggage by the car.  He
liked riding to Ottalie.  It was a difficult ride, he
thought, owing to the blasts which beat down from the
hills, but there came a moment, as he well remembered,
rather near to the end of the journey, when the hills
gave place to mountains.  Here the road, topping a
crest, fell away, shewing a valley and a stretch of sea.
Hills and headlands rolled north in ranks to a bluish
haze.  The crag beyond all rose erect from the surf,
an upright, defined line in the blueness.  From
Ottalie's home, high up, he could see that great crag.
With an opera-glass he could see the surf bursting
below it.  It was now eight o'clock.  The morning boat
was coming in.  He would start.  By lunch-time he
would be in his little cottage above the sea.  He would
swim before lunch.  After lunch he would climb
through the long grey avenue of beeches to Ottalie's
home.  The old excitement came over him to give to
his ardour the memory of many other rides to her.
</p>

<p>
Riding through the squalid town he found himself
reckoning up little curious particular details of things
seen by him on similar journeys in the past.  The
clatter of the "long car" behind him made him spurt
ahead.  It was a point of vanity with him to beat the
car over the forty-mile course.  The last thing noticed
by him as he cleared the town was a yellow affiche,
bearing the legend:
</p>

<p class="t3">

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The sun was golden over all the marvel of
Ireland.  The sea came in sight from time to
time.  Beyond a cliff castle a gannet dropped,
white and swift, with a splash which faintly came to
him a quarter of a mile away.  Turning inland, he
rode into the hills.  Little low rolling green hills,
wooded and sunny, lay ahead.  On each side of him
were pastures unspeakably green, sleepily cropped by
cattle.  He set himself to ride hard through this bright
land.  He spurted up the little hills, dipped down, and
again climbed.  He was eager to reach a gate on a
hilltop, from which he could see the headland which shut
him from the land of his desire.  As he rode, he thought
burningly of what that afternoon would be to him.
Ottalie might not be there.  She might be away.  She
might be out; but something told him she would be
there.  With Ottalie in the world, the world did not
matter greatly.  The thought of Ottalie gave him a fine
sense, only properly enjoyed in youth, of his own
superiority to the world.  With a thumping heart, due
not to emotion, but to riding uphill, he climbed the
gate, and looked out over the beautiful fields to the
distant headland.  There it lay, gleaming, fifteen miles
away.  Beyond it was Ottalie.  Protesters, in old,
unhappy far-off times, had painted a skull and cross-bones
on the gate, as, in other parts, they dug graves at front
doors, or fired with lucky slugs from cover.  The bones
were covered with lichen, now; but the skull grinned
at Roger friendly, as it had often grinned.  Riding on,
and glancing back over his shoulder, at risk of going
into the ditch, he saw the skull's eyes fixed upon him.
</p>

<p>
The last part of the ride was downhill.  He lifted his
bicycle over a low stone wall, and vaulted over after it.
The sea was within fifty yards of him, in brimming
flood.  Norah Kennedy, the old woman who kept house
for him, was there at the door, looking out.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, Mr. Naldrett," she began; "the blessing
of God on you.  I was feared the boat was gone down
on you.  It's a sad time this for you to be coming here.
Indeed, I never saw you looking better.  You're liker
your mother than your da.  He was a grand man, your
da, of all the folks ever I remember.  Indeed, your
dinner is just ready for you.  Will I wet the tea, sir?"
</p>

<p>
The old woman rambled on from subject to subject,
glancing at each, so lightly, that one less used to her
ways would not have suspected the very shrewd and
bitter critic hidden beneath the charm of the superficial
nature.  Roger felt somehow that the critic was alert
in her, that she resented something in his manner or
dress.  He concluded that he was late, or that she,
perhaps in her zeal for him, had put on the joint too
early.  As usual, when she was not pleased, she served
the dinner muttering personal remarks, not knowing
(as is the way with lonely old people, who talk to
themselves) that they were sometimes audible.  "I'll do you
no peas for your supper, my man," was one of her
asides, when he helped himself sparingly to peas.  "It's
easy seen you're only an Englishman," was another, at
his national diffidence towards a potato.  Roger
wondered what was wrong, and how soon he would become
again "the finest young man ever I remember, except
perhaps it was your da.  Indeed, Mr. Roger, to see your
da, and him riding wast in a red coat, you would think
it was the Queen's man,* or one of the Saints of God.
There was no one I ever seen had the glory on him your
da had, unless it was yourself stepping."  Roger's da
had died of drink there, after a life passed in the
preservation of the game laws.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
* The late Prince Consort.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
When his baggage arrived, he dressed carefully, and
set out up the hill to Ottalie's house, which he could
see, even from his cottage, as a white, indeterminate
mass, screened by trees from sea-winds.  The road
branched off into a loaning, hedged with tumbled stone
on each side.  As he climbed the loaning, the roguish
Irish bulls, coming in a gallop, at the sound of his feet,
peered down at him, through hedges held together by
Providence, or left to the bulls' imagination.  A lusty
white bull followed him for some time, restrained only
by a foot-high wire.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," said an old labourer, who, resting by the
way, expressed sympathy both for Roger and the bull,
"he's only a young bull.  He wad do no one anny
hurrt, except maybe he felt that way.  Let you not
trouble, sir."
</p>

<p>
Up above Ottalie's house was the garden.  The
garden wall backed upon the loaning.  A little blue
door with peeling, blistered paint, let him into the
garden, into a long, straight rose-walk, in which the
roses had not yet begun to bloom.  A sweet-smelling
herb grew by the door.  He crumpled a leaf of it
between his fingers, thinking how wonderful the earth
was, which could grow this fragrance, out of mould
and rain.  The bees were busy among the flowers.
The laurustine was giving out sweetness.  In the sun
of that windless afternoon, the smell thickened the air
above the path, making it a warm clot of perfume, to
breathe which was to breathe beginning life.  Butterflies
wavered, keeping low down, in the manner of
butterflies near the coast.  Birds made musical calls,
sudden delightful exclamations, startling laughter, as
though the god Pan laughed to himself among the
laurustine bushes.
</p>

<p>
He felt the beauty of the late Irish season as he had
never before felt it.  It stirred him to the excitement
which is beyond poetry, to that delighted sensitiveness,
in which the mind, tremulously open, tremulously alive,
can neither select nor combine.  He longed to be
writing poetry; but in the open air the imagination is
subordinated to the senses.  The lines which formed in his
mind were meaningless exclamations.  Nature is a
setting, merely.  The soul of man, which alone, of created
things, regards her, is the important thing.
</p>

<p>
The blinds of the sunny southern front were drawn
down; but the marks of carriage wheels upon the drive
shewed him that she had returned.  After ringing, he
listened for the crackled tinkle far away in the kitchen,
and turning, saw a squirrel leap from one beech to
another, followed by three or four sparrows.  Footsteps
shuffled near.  Somewhere outside, at the back, an old
woman's voice asked whiningly for a bit of bread, for
the love of the Almighty God, since she was perished
with walking and had a cough on her that would raise
pity in a martial man.  A younger voice, high, clear,
and hard, bidding her whisht, and let her get out of it,
ceased suddenly, in her prohibition.  The door opened.
There was old Mary Laverty, the housekeeper.
</p>

<p>
"How are you, Mary?  Are you quite well?"
</p>

<p>
"I am, sir.  I thank you."
</p>

<p>
"Is Miss Fawcett in?"
</p>

<p>
"Have you not heard, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Heard what?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Ottalah's dead, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"She was drowned in the boat that was run into,
crossing the sea, two days ago.  There was a fog, sir.
Did no one tell you, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"There was eleven of them drowned, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Was she ...  Is she lying here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  She's within.  The burying will no be
till Saturday.  She is no chested yet."
</p>

<p>
"Was Miss Agatha with her?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Agatha was not in the cabbon.  She was not
wetted, indeed.  She had not so much as her skirrt
wetted, sir.  She is within, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think she would see me?"
</p>

<p>
"Come in, sir.  I will ask."
</p>

<p>
He stepped in, feeling stunned.  His mind gave him
an image of something hauled ashore.  There was an
image of a dripping thing being carried by men up the
drive, the gravel crunched under their boots&mdash;crunch&mdash;crunch
in slow time, then a rest at the door, and then,
slowly, into the hall, and drip, drip, up the stairs to the
darkened bedroom.  Then out again, reverently, fumbling
their hats, to talk about it with the cook.  He did
not realise what had happened.  Here he was in the
room.  There was his photograph.  There was the
Oriental bowl full of potpourri.  Ottalie had been
drowned.  Ottalie was lying upstairs, a dead thing,
with neither voice nor movement.  Ottalie was dead.
She had sat with him in that very room.  The old
precise sofa was her favourite seat.  How could she be
dead?  She had been in London, asking for him, only
two days before.  Her letter was in his pocket.  There
was her music.  There was her violin.  Why did she
not come in, as of old, with her smiling daintiness, and
with her hands in great gardening gauntlets clasping
tulips for the jars?  That beauty was over for the
world.
</p>

<p>
He was stunned by it.  He did not know what was
happening; but there was Agatha, motioning to him
not to get up.  He said something about pity.  "I
pity you."  After a minute, he added, "My God!"  He
was trying to say something to comfort her.  The
change in her told him that it was all true.  It branded
it into him.  Ottalie was dead, and this was what it
meant to the world.  This was death, this horror.
</p>

<p>
His mind groped about like a fainting man for something
to clutch.  Baudelaire's lines rose up before him.
The sentiment of French decadence, with its fancy of
ingratitude, made him shudder.  A turmoil of quotations
seethed and died down in him, "And is old Double
dead?"  "Come away, death," with a phrase of Arne's
setting.  A wandering strange phrase of Grieg.
</p>

<p>
He went up to Agatha and took her hands.
</p>

<p>
"You poor thing; you poor thing," he repeated.
"My God, you poor women suffer!"  The clock was
ticking all the time.  Some one was bringing tea to the
next room.  The lines in the Persian rug had a horrible
regularity.  "Agatha," he said.  Afterwards he
believed that he kissed her, and that she thanked him.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  I don't know," she said.  "Oh,
I'm so very wretched.  So wretched.  So wretched.
And I can't die."  She shook in a passion of tears.
</p>

<p>
"She was wonderful," he said, choking.  "She was
so beautiful.  All she did."
</p>

<p>
"She was with me a minute before," said Agatha.
"We were on deck.  She went down to get a wrap.
It was so cold in the fog.  I had left her wraps in the
dining-room.  It was my fault."
</p>

<p>
"Don't say that, Agatha.  That's nonsense."
</p>

<p>
"I never saw her again.  It all happened at once.
The next instant we were run into.  I couldn't see
anything.  There was a crash, which made us heel right
over, and then there was a panic.  I didn't know what
had happened.  I tried to get down to her; but a lot
of half-drunk tourists came raving and fighting to get
to the boats.  I couldn't get to the doors past them.
One of them hit me with his fist and swore at me.  The
ship was sinking.  I nearly got to the door, and then a
stewardess cried out that everybody was up from below,
and then a great brute of a man flung me into a boat.
I hit my head.  When I came to, I distinctly felt some
one pulling off my rings, and there was a sort of
weltering noise where the ship had sunk.  One of the tourists
cried out: 'Wot-ow!  A shipwreck; oh, Polly.'  Everybody
was shouting all round us, and there was a
poor little child crying.  I caught at the hand which
was taking my rings."  Here she stopped.  There had
been some final humiliation here.  She went on after
a moment: "The men said that every one had been
saved.  I didn't know till we all landed.  Nor till after
that even.  It was so foggy.  Then I knew.
</p>

<p>
"There was a very kind Scotch lady who took me to
the hotel.  She was very kind.  I don't know who she
was.  The divers came from Belfast during the night.
Ottalie was in the saloon.  She was wearing her wraps.
She must have just put them on.  There were five
others in the saloon.  The inquest was ghastly.  One
of the witnesses was drunk, and the jury were laughing.
The waiter at the hotel knew me.  He wired to Leslie,
and Leslie hired a motor and came over.  Colonel
Fawcett is in bed with sciatica.  Leslie is arranging
everything."
</p>

<p>
"Is Leslie here?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Maggie has bronchitis.  He had to go back.
He'll be here late to-night."
</p>

<p>
"I might have been with you, Agatha.  If I'd stayed
in another minute on Tuesday morning, I should have
seen her.  I should have travelled with you.  It
wouldn't have happened.  I should have gone for the
wraps."
</p>

<p>
"We saw you at your play, on Monday."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know you were in town.  Oh, if I had only
known!"
</p>

<p>
"It was my fault that you did not know.  I kept
back her letter to you.  I was jealous.  I was wicked.
I think the devil was in me."
</p>

<p>
"Don't think of that now," said Roger gently.  He
had known it from the first.  "Is there anything which
I can do, Agatha?  Letters to write?"
</p>

<p>
"There are stacks of letters.  They all say the same
thing.  Oh, I am so wretched, so very wretched!"  The
shuddering took hold of her.  She wept in a
shaking tremble which seemed to tear her in pieces.
</p>

<p>
"Agatha," said Roger, "will you come to Belfast
with me?  I will hire the motor in the village.  I must
get some flowers.  It would do you good to come."
</p>

<p>
"No.  I must stay.  I shall only have her two days
more."
</p>

<p>
He would have asked to look upon Ottalie; but he
refrained, in the presence of that passion.  Agatha had
enough to bear.  He would not flick her jealousies.
Ottalie was lying just overhead, within a dozen feet of
him.  Ten minutes ago he had been thinking of her as
a lover thinks of his beloved.  His heart had been
leaping with the thought of her.  There she was, in that
quiet room, behind the blinds, lying on the bed, still and
blank.  And where was what had made her so wonderful?
Where was the spirit who had used her as a lodging?
She had been all that makes woman wonderful.
Beautiful with beauty of mind; a perfect, perfect spirit.
And she was dead.  She was lying upstairs dead.  And
here were her two lovers, listening to the clock, listening
to the spade-strokes in the garden, where old John was
at work.  The smell of the potpourri, which she had
made the summer before, seemed as strong as incense.
The portrait by Raeburn, of her great-grandfather,
looked down dispassionately, with eyes that were very
like her eyes.  The clock had told the time to that old
soldier when he went to be painted.  It had gone on
ticking ever since.  It had been ticking when the old
soldier died, when his son died, when his grandson died.
Now she was dead, and it was ticking still, a solemn old
clock, by Frodsham, of Sackville Street, Dublin, 1797,
the year before the rising.  It would be ticking still,
perhaps, when all the hearts then alive would have
ceased to tick.  There was something pitiless in that
steady beat.  Three or four generations of Fawcetts had
had their lives measured by it, all those beautiful
women and noble soldiers.  All the "issue" mentioned
in Burke.
</p>

<p>
He went out into the light.  All the world seemed
melted into emotion, and poured upon him.  He was
beaten.  It poured upon him.  He drew it in with his
breath.  Everything within sight was an agony with
memories of her.  "I must be doing something," he
said aloud.  "I must get flowers.  I shall wake up
presently."  He turned at the gate, his mind surging.
"Could Agatha be sure that she is dead?  Perhaps I
am dead.  Or it may be a dream."  It was not a dream.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the loaning he met a red-haired
man from whom in old time he had bought a boat.
</p>

<p>
"It's a fine day, sir," said the man.
</p>

<p>
"John," said Roger, "tell Pat Deloney I want the
car, to go to Belfast at once.  I shall want him to drive.
Tell him to come for me here."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, sir," said John, looking at him narrowly.
"There's many feeling that way.  There was a light
on her you'd think it was a saint, and her coming east
with brightness."
</p>

<p>
After John had gone down to the village, there limped
up an old, old, half-witted drunken poet, who fiddled
at regattas.  He saluted Roger, who leaned on a gate,
staring uphill towards the house.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, Mr. Roger," said the old man; "there's
a strong sorrow on the place this day.  There was a
light burning beyant.  I seen the same for her da, and
for her da's da.  There was them beyant wanted her."  He
waited for Roger to speak, but getting no answer
began to ramble in Irish, and then craved for maybe a
sixpence, because "indeed, I knew your da, Mr. Roger.
Ah, your da was a grand man, would turn the heads of
all the women, and they great queens itself, having the
pick of professors and prime ministers and any one
they'd a mind to."
</p>

<p>
After a time, singing to himself in Irish, he limped
on up the loaning to the house, to beg maybe a bit of
bread, in exchange for the fact that he had seen a light
burning for her, just as he had seen it for her da, her
da's da, and (when the kitchen brandy had arisen in
him) her da's da's da years ago.
</p>

<p>
The car came snorting up the hill, and turned in the
broad expanse where the loaning joined the highway.
John opened the door for Roger.  "If I was a young
gentleman and had the right to do it," he said, "I
would go in a cyar the like of that cyar down all the
craggy precipices of the world."  The car shook, spat,
and darted.  "Will ye go by Torneymoney?" said Pat.
"There's no rossers that way."
</p>

<p>
"By Torneymoney," said Roger.  "Drive hard."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," said Pat; "we will do great deeds this
day.  We will make a strong story by the blessing of
God.  Let you hold tight, your honour.  There's holes
in this road would give a queer twist to a sea-admiral."
</p>

<p>
The funeral was on Saturday.  About a dozen men
came.  There were five or six Fawcetts and old
Mr. Laramie, who had married Maisie Fawcett, Ottalie's
aunt, one of the beauties of her time.  The rest were
friends from the countryside, Englishmen in faith,
education, and feeling.  They stood with bared heads in
the little lonely Protestant graveyard, as Roman
soldiers may have stood by the pyres of their mates in
Britain.  They were aliens there.  They were part of
the garrison.  They were hiding under the ground
something too good and beautiful to belong to that
outcast country.  Roger had the fancy that God would
have to be very strong to hold that outpost.  He had
not slept for two nights.  Sentiments and fancies were
overwhelming him.  It was one of those Irish days in
which a quality or rarity in the air gives a magic, either
alluring or terrible, to every bush and brook and hillock.
He had often thought that Ireland was a haunted
country.  He thought so now, standing by Ottalie's grave.
Just beyond the graveyard was the river, which was
"bad," and beyond that again a hill.  The hill was so
"bad," that the beggarwomen, passing in the road,
muttering at "the mouldy old Prots, playing at their
religion, God save us," crossed themselves as they went
by it.  Roger prayed that that fair spirit might be at
peace, among all this invisible evil.  His hand went
into his breast pocket from time to time to touch her
letter to him.  He watched Leslie Fawcett, whose face
was so like hers, and old Mr. Laramie, who had won
the beauty of her time, and an old uncle Fawcett, who
had fought in Africa, sixty years before.  The graves
of other Fawcetts lay in that corner of the graveyard.
He read their names, remembering them from Burke.
He read the texts upon the stones.  The texts had been
put there in agonies of remorse and love and memory by
the men and women who played croquet in an old
daguerreotype in Ottalie's sitting-room.  "He giveth
His beloved sleep," and "It is well with the child," and
one, a strange one, "Lord, have patience with me, and
I will pay Thee all."  They had been beautiful and
noble, these Fawcetts.  Not strong, not clever, but
wonderful.  They had had a spirit, a spiritual quality, as
though for many, many centuries their women had kept
themselves unspotted by anything not noble.  An instinct
for style running in the race of the Fawcetts for
centuries had made them what they were.
</p>

<p>
A hope burned up in Roger like inspiration.  All
that instinct for fineness, that fastidious selection of the
right and good which had worked to make Ottalie, from
long before her birth, and had flowered in her, was
surely eternal.  She had used life to make her character
beautiful and gentle, just as he had used life to
discipline his mind to the expression of his imagination.
"What's to come" was still unsure; but he felt sure,
even as the trembling old incumbent reminded them
that St. Paul had bidden them not to sorrow, that that
devotion was stronger than death.  Her spirit might be
out in the night, he thought, as in time his would be;
but what could assail that devotion?  It was a strong
thing, it was a holy thing.  He was very sure that
nothing would overcome it.  Like many young men, ignorant
of death, he had believed in metempsychosis.  This
blow of death had brought down that fancy with all the
other card-houses of his mind.  His nature was now, as
it were, humbled to its knees, wondering, stricken, and
appalled by possibilities of death undreamed of.  He
could not feel that Ottalie would live again, in a new
body, starting afresh, in a new life-machine, with all
the acquired character of the past life as a reserve of
strength.  He could only feel that somewhere in that
great empty air, outside the precise definition of living
forms, Ottalie, the little, conquered kingdom of beauty
and goodness, existed still.  It was something.  Newman's
hymn, with its lovely closing couplet, moved him
and comforted him.  One of the Fawcetts was crying,
snuffling, with a firm mouth, as men usually cry.  He
himself was near to tears.  He was being torn by the
thought that Ottalie was lonely, very lonely and frightened,
out there beyond life, beyond the order of defined
live things.
</p>

<p>
He walked back with Leslie Fawcett.  Agatha's
mother was at the house; Leslie was stopping in the
cottage with him.
</p>

<p>
"Poor little Ollie," said Leslie gently.
</p>

<p>
"She was very beautiful," said Roger.  He thought,
as he said it, that it was a strange thing for an
Englishman to say to a dead woman's brother.  "She was very
beautiful.  It must be terrible to you.  You knew her
in an intimate relation."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Leslie, looking hard at Roger, out of
grave level eyes.  "She was a very perfect character."
</p>

<p>
They were climbing the cliff road to the cottage.
The sea was just below them.  The water was ruffled
to whiteness.  Sullivan's jobble stretched in breakers
across the bay from Cam Point.  Gannets, plunging in
the jobble, flung aloft white founts, as though shot were
striking.
</p>

<p>
"You were very great friends," said Roger.  "I
mean, even for brother and sister."
</p>

<p>
"Johnny was her favourite brother, as a child," said
Leslie.  "You did not see much of Johnny.  He was
killed in the war.  And then he was in India a long
time.  It was after Johnny's death that Ottalie and I
began to be so much to each other.  You see, Agatha
was only with her about five months in the year.  She
was with us nearly that each year.  She was wonderful
with children."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Roger, holding open the gate of the
little garden so that his guest might pass, "I know."  He
was not likely to forget how wonderful she had been
with children.  They went into the little sitting-room
where Norah, in one of her black moods, gave them tea.
After tea they sat in the garden, looking out over the
low hedge at the bay.  At sunset they walked along the
coast to a place which they had called "the cove."  They
had used to bathe there.  A little brook tumbled
over a rock in a forty-foot fall.  Below the fall was a
pool, overgrown later in the year with meadow-sweet
and honeysuckle, but clear now, save for the rushes and
brambles.  The brook slid out from the basin over a
reddish rock worn smooth, even in its veins and
knuckles, by many centuries of trickling.  Storms had
piled shingle below this side of water.  The brook
dribbled to the sea unseen, making a gurgling, tinkling
noise.  Up above, at the place where the fall first leapt,
among some ash-trees, windy and grey, stood what was
left of a nunnery, of reddish stone, fire-blackened,
among a company of tumbled gravestones.
</p>

<p>
Of all the places sacred to Ottalie in Roger's mind,
that was the most sacred.  They had been happy there.
They had talked intimately there, moved by the place's
beauty.  His most vivid memories of her had that
beautiful place for their setting.
</p>

<p>
"Roger," said Leslie, "did you see her in town,
before this happened?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"You did not see her?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Not this time."
</p>

<p>
"She was going to see you."
</p>

<p>
"I believe she came just before she started.  I had
just gone out.  We missed each other."
</p>

<p>
Leslie lifted his pince-nez.  He was looking at Roger,
with the grave, steady look by which people remembered
him.  Roger thought afterwards that his putting
on of the pince-nez had been done tenderly, as though
he had said, "I see that you are suffering.  With these
glasses I shall see how to help you."
</p>

<p>
"You were in love with her?" he asked, in a low
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Who was not?"
</p>

<p>
"I have something to say to you about that.  Have
you ever thought of what marriage means?  I am not
talking of the passionate side.  That is nothing.  I am
talking of the everyday aspect of married life.  Have
you thought of that at all?"
</p>

<p>
"All men have thought of it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I grant you.  All men have thought of it.
But do many of them think it home?  Have you?
I imagine that most men never follow the thought
home; but leave it in day-dreams, and images of
selfishness.  I don't think that many men realise how
infinitely much finer in quality the woman's mind is.
Nor how much more delicately quick it is.  Nor what
the clash of that quickness and fineness, with something
duller and grosser, may entail, in ordinary everyday
life, to the woman."
</p>

<p>
"I think that I realise it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, perhaps.  Perhaps you do realise it, as an
intellectual question.  But would you, do most men,
realise it as life realises it?  It is one thing to imagine
one's duty to one's wife, when, as a bachelor, used to all
manner of self-indulgence, one sits smoking over the
fire.  But to carry out that duty in life taxes the
character.  Swiftness of responsion, tact, is rarer than
genius.  I imagine that with you, temporary sensation
counts for more than an ordered, and possibly rigid,
attitude, towards life as a whole."
</p>

<p>
"Both count for very much; or did.  Nothing seems
very much at this moment."
</p>

<p>
"Ottalie loved you," said Leslie simply.  "But she
felt that there was this want in you, of so thinking
things home that they become character.  She thought
you too ready to surrender to immediate and, perhaps,
wayward emotions.  She was not sure that you could
help her to be the finest thing possible to her, nor that
she could so help you."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know this?"
</p>

<p>
"She discussed it with me.  She wanted my help.
I said that I ought not to interfere, but that, on the
whole, I thought that she was right.  That, in fact,
your love was not in the depths of your nature.  I said
this; but I added that you were too sensitive to
impressions not to grow, and that (rightly influenced)
there is hardly anything which you might not become.
The danger which threatens you seems to me to threaten
all artists.  Art is a great strain.  It compels
selfishness.  I have wondered whether, if things had been
different, if you had married Ottalie, you could have
come from creating heroines to tend a wife's headache;
or, with a headache yourself, have seen the heroine in
her.  We have life before us.  You are all tenderness
and nobleness now.  It is sad that we have not this
always in our minds."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Roger.  "We have life; and all my old
life is a house of cards.  Before this it seemed a noble
thing to strive with my whole strength to express
certain principles, and to give reality and beauty to
imagined character.  I worked to please her.  And often
I did not understand her, and did not know her.  I
have walked in her mind, and the houses were all shut
up.  I could only knock at the doors and listen.  And
now I never shall know.  I only know that she was a
very beautiful thing, and that I loved her, and tried to
make my work worthy of her."
</p>

<p>
"She loved you, too," said Leslie.  "Whatever death
may be, we ought to look upon it as a part of life.
Try to be all that you might have been with her.  Never
mind about your work.  You have been too fond of
emotional self-indulgence.  Set that aside, and go on.
She would have married you.  Try to realise that.
Her nature would have been a part of yours.  All
your character would have been sifted and tested and
refined by her.  Now let us go in, Roger.  Tell me what
you are going to do."
</p>

<p>
"There is not much to do.  I must try to rearrange
my life.  But I see one thing, I think, that art is very
frightful when it has not the seriousness of life and
death in it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Leslie.  "Maggie and I went into that
together.  We built up a theory that the art life is
strangely like the life of the religious contemplative.
Both attract men by the gratification of emotion as well
as by the possibility of perfection.  One of the great
Spanish saints, I think it is St. John of Avila, says that
many novices deliberately indulge themselves in
religious emotion, for the sake of the emotion, instead of
for the love of God; but that the knowledge of God is
only revealed to those who get beyond that stage, and
can endure stages of 'stypticities and drynesses,' with
the same fervour.  It seems to us (of course we are
both Philistines) that modern art does not take enough
out of those who produce it.  The world flatters them
too much.  I suspect that flattery of the world is going
on in return."
</p>

<p>
"Not from the best."
</p>

<p>
Leslie shook his head unconvinced.  "You are not
producing martyrs," he said.  "You do not attack bad
things.  You laugh at them, or photograph them, and
call it satire.  You belong to the world, my friend
Roger.  You are a part of the vanity of the world, the
flesh, and the devil.  You have not even made the idea
of woman glorious in men's minds.  Otherwise they
would have votes and power in the Houses.  Not one of
you has even been imprisoned for maiming a censor of
plays.  All the generations have a certain amount of
truth revealed to them.  It is very dangerous to
discover truth.  You can learn what kind of truth is being
revealed to an age by noting what kind of people give
their lives for ideas.  It used at one time to be bishops.
Think of it."
</p>

<p>
Leslie talked on, shaping the talk as he had planned it
beforehand, but pointing it so gently that it was not till
afterwards that Roger, realising his motives, gave him
thanks for his unselfishness.  They stopped on the
rushy hill below Ottalie's home, just as the sun, now
sinking, flamed out upon her window, till it burned like
the sun itself.  To Roger it seemed like a flaming door.
She had looked out there, from that window.  Her
little writing-table, with its jar of sweet peas, and that
other jar, of autumn berries and the silvery parchment
of honesty, stood just below it, on each side of the
blotter, bound in mottled chintz.  Leslie's talk came
home to him fiercely.  The clawings of remorse came.
He knew the room.  He had never known the inmate.
She was gone.  He had wasted his chance.  He might
have known her; but he had preferred to indulge in
those emotions and sentiments which keep the soul from
knowledge.  Now she was gone.  All the agony of
remorse cried out in him for one little moment in the
room with her, to tell her that he loved her, for one
little word of farewell, one sight of the beloved face, so
that he might remember it forever.  Memories rose up,
choking him.  She was gone.  There was only the
flaming door.
</p>

<p>
"Roger," said Leslie, in his even, gentle voice, which
had such a quality of attraction in it, "Maggie asked
me to bring you back with me to stay a couple of
weeks."
</p>

<p>
In his confused sleep that night he dreamed that
Ottalie was lying ill in her room, behind a bolted copper
door which gleamed.  The passage without the room
was lighted.  People came to the door to knock.  A
long procession of people came.  He saw them listening
intently there, with their ears bent to the keyhole.
They were all the people who had been in love with her.
Some were relatives, some were men who had seen her
at dances, some were women, some were old friends like
himself.  Last of all came an elderly lady carrying a
light.  She was dressed in a robe of dim purple.  She,
too, knocked sharply on the door.  She lingered there,
long enough for him to study her fine, intellectual face.
It was the face of Ottalie grown old.  The woman was
the completed Ottalie.
</p>

<p>
For a moment she stood there listening, as one listens
at the door of a sick-room.  Then she knocked a second
time, sharply, calling "Ottalie!"  He saw then that it
was not a door but a flame.  He heard from within a
strangled answer, as though some one, half dead, had
risen to open.  Some one was coming to the door.
Even in his dream his blood leaped with the expectation
of his love.
</p>

<p>
But it was not his love.  It was himself, strangling
in the flames to get to her.  She reached her hand to
him.  Though the flames were stifling, he touched her.
It was as though the agony of many years had been
changed suddenly to ecstasy.  "Roger," she said.
Her hand caught him, she drew him through the fire to
her.  He saw her raise the candle to look at his face.
For a moment they were looking at each other, there in
the passage.  The agony was over.  They were together,
looking into each other's eyes.  He felt her life
coursing into him from her touch.
</p>

<p>
Voices spoke without.  Norah, at the door, was
haggling.  "Is that all the milk ye've brought, Kitty
O'Hara?"
</p>

<p>
The dream faded away as the life broke in upon him.
There was some word, some song.  Some one with a
fine voice was singing outside, singing in the dream,
singing about a fever.  Ottalie was holding him, but
her touch was fading from his sense, and joy was
rushing from him.  Outside, on the top spray of the
blackthorn, a yellow-hammer trilled, "A little bit of bread
and no&mdash;che-e-e-e-se," telling him that the world was
going on.
</p>

<p>
The fortnight passed.  Roger was going back to
London.  The day before he sailed he rode over with
Leslie to take a last look at Ottalie's home.  He left
Leslie at the cottage, so that he might go there alone.
He walked alone up the loaning.  Within the garden he
paused, looking down at the house.  The smell of the
sweet verbena was very strong, in that mild damp air,
full of the promise of rain.  A paper was blowing about
along the walk.  A white kitten, romping out from the
stable, pounced on it, worried it with swift gougings
of the hind claws, then, spitting, with ears laid back
and tail bristling, raced away for a swift climb up a
pear-tree.  Roger picked up the paper.  It would be a
relic of the place.  He felt inclined to treasure
everything there, to take the house, never to go away from it,
or, failing that, to carry away many of her favourite
flowers.  He straightened the paper so that he might
read it.
</p>

<p>
It was a double page from a year-old London paper
entitled <i>Top-Knots</i>.  It consisted of scraps of gossip,
scraps of news, scraps of information, seasoned with
imperial feeling.  It had been edited by some one with
a sense of the purity of the home.  It was harmless
stuff.  The wisdom of the reader was flattered; the
wisdom of the foreigner was not openly condemned.
Though some fear of invasion was implied, its
possibility was flouted.  "It was a maxim of our Nelson
that one Englishman was worth three foreigners."  The
jokes were feeble.  The paper catered for a class
of poor, half-educated people without more leisure than
the morning ride to business, and the hour of
exhaustion between supper and bed.  It was well enough in
its way.  Some day, when life is less exhausting, men
will demand stuff with more life.  Something caught
Roger's eye.  He read it through.  It was the first
thing read by him since his arrival there.

  "SLEEPING SICKNESS.<br />
</p>

<p>
"It is not generally known that this devastating
ailment is caused by the presence of a minute
micro-organism in the human system.  The micro-organism
may exist in unsuspected harmlessness for many years
in the victim's blood.  It is not until it enters what is
known to scientists as the cerebro-spinal fluid, or as we
should call it, the marrow, that it sets up the peculiar
symptoms of the dread disease which has so far baffled
the ingenuity of our <i>soi-disant</i> savants.  This terrible
affliction, which is not by any means confined to those
inferior members of the human race, the dusky
inhabitants of Uganda, consists of a lethargy accompanied
with great variations of temperature.  So far the dread
complaint is without a remedy.  Well may the medico
echo the words of the Prince of Denmark:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br />
  Than are dreamed of in your philosophy.'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There was no more about the disease.  The page
ended with a joke about a mother-in-law.  The
paragraph made Roger remember an article which he had
once read about the sudden rise of the sickness in some
district in Africa.  He remembered the photograph of
a young African, who was dozing his life away, propped
against a tree.  The thought passed.  In another
instant he was full of his own misery again.  But
instead of throwing away the paper, he folded it, and put
it in his pocket-case.  It would remind him of that last
visit to Ottalie's garden.  He would keep it forever.
</p>

<p>
His wretchedness gave him a craving to be tender to
something.  He tried to attract the kitten, but the
kitten, tiring of her romp, scampered to the garden wall
to stalk sparrows.  He plucked a leaf or two from the
verbena.  He went into the house.
</p>

<p>
Agatha welcomed him.  She was writing replies to
letters of condolence.  The death had taken her
hardness from her.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down and talk," she said.  "What are you going to do?"
</p>

<p>
"That is like a woman," he said.  "Women are
wonderful.  They use a man's vanity to protect
themselves from his egotism.  I came here to ask you that.
What are you going to do?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall go on with my work," she said.  "I am sure
not to marry.  I shall start a little school for poor
girls."
</p>

<p>
"At Great Harley?  But you were doing that before."
</p>

<p>
"Only in a very desultory sort of way.  But now it
is all different.  Life has become so much bigger."
</p>

<p>
"Will you tell me about it?  I should like to hear
about it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it would only bore you.  I shall just teach
them the simplest things.  How to darn clothes, how
to cook, and perhaps a little singing.  It isn't as though
I were a learned person."
</p>

<p>
"How kind of you."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't kind at all."
</p>

<p>
"You will be taking girls of from thirteen to sixteen?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I've got no flair for very little children.
Besides, there is nothing which I could teach them.  I
want to get hold of them at an age when I can really
be of use to them."
</p>

<p>
She drummed a little with one foot.
</p>

<p>
"I wish that you would let me help you," he continued.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you very much.  That is very kind of you.
But I must do this quite by myself."
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do with the flat in town?"
he asked.  "I should like to take it if you are going
to give it up."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I shall keep it on," she said.  "I shall be up
for week-ends a good deal, at any rate until I have got
my class in working order."
</p>

<p>
"You will let me know if you ever want to give it up?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Certainly I will.  Will you go back?  I
suppose you will be going back to your work.  What
are your plans?  You never answered my question.
You went flying off into apophthegms."
</p>

<p>
"I loved Ottalie, too," he answered.  "I won't say
as much as you did, for you knew her intimately.  I
never was soul to soul with her as you were; but I
loved her.  I want now to make my life worthy of her,
as you do.  But it won't be in my work.  I don't know
what it will be in.  You women are lucky.  You can
know people like her."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I shall always be glad of that," said Agatha.
"Even the loss is bearable when I think that I knew
her fully.  Perhaps better than any one."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said.  He paused, turning it over in his
mind.  "Life is a conspiracy against women," he
added.  "That is why they are so wonderful and so
strange.  I am only groping in the dark about her."
</p>

<p>
"Roger," said Agatha, speaking slowly, "I think I
ought to tell you.  I knew that you were in love with
her.  I was jealous of you.  I did all that I could to
keep you apart.  She was in love with you.  When she
saw you at the theatre before the disturbance began,
she would have gone to your box if I had not said that I
was sure you would prefer to be alone.  In the morning
she saw what one of the papers said.  She insisted on
going to see you at your rooms.  She said that she was
sure you were expecting her, or that something had
kept her letters from you.  I told her that it wasn't
a very usual thing to do.  She said that she would talk
about that afterwards.  Afterwards, when she had
gone, and failed to see you, she was horrified at what
you might think of her."
</p>

<p>
It was very sweet to hear more of her, thus, after all
was over.  It was something new about her.  He had
never seen that side of her.  He wondered how much
more Agatha would tell him, or permit him to learn, in
years to come.  He saw that she was near tears.  He
was not going to keep her longer on the rack.
</p>

<p>
"Agatha," he said, "we have been at cross-purposes
for a long time now.  We have not been just to each
other.  Let it end now.  We both loved her.  Don't let
it go on, now that she is dead.  I want to feel that the
one who knew her best is my friend.  I want you to let
me help you, as a brother might, whenever you want
help.  Will you?"
</p>

<p>
She said, "Thank you, Roger."  They shook hands.
He remembered afterwards how the lustre of the
honesty shewed behind her head.  A worn old panther skin,
the relic of a beast which had been shot in India by
Ottalie's father so many years before that the hairless
hide was like parchment beneath the feet, crackled as
she left the room.  Roger plucked some of the silvery
seed vessels for remembrance.
</p>

<p>
He stood in the hall for a moment trying to fix it in
his mind.  There was the barometer, by Dakins, of
South Castle Street, in Liverpool, an old piece,
handsome, but long since useless.  There were the
well-remembered doors.  The dining-room door, the library
door, the door leading into the jolly south room, the
room sweet with the vague perfume, almost the memory
of a perfume, as though the ghosts of flowers strayed
there.  The door of that room was open.  Through its
open windows he could see the blue of the bay, twinkling
to the wind.  Near the window was the piano, heaped
with music.  A waltz lay upon the piano: the Myosotis
Waltz.  Let no one despise dance music.  It is the
music which breaks the heart.  It is full of lights and
scents, the laughter of pretty women and youth's
triumph.  To the man or woman who has failed in life
the sound of such music is bitter.  It is youth
reproaching age.  It indicates the anti-climax.
</p>

<p>
He walked with Leslie through the village.  The
ragged men on the bridge, hearing them coming, turned,
and touched what had once been their hats to them.
They were not made for death, those old men.  They
were the only Irish things which the English tourist
had not corrupted.  They leant on the parapet all day.
In the forenoons they looked at the road and at the
people passing.  In the afternoons, when the sun made
their old eyes blink, they turned and looked into the
water, where it gurgled over rusty cans, a clear brown
peat-stream.  A quarter of a mile up the stream was
the graveyard, where the earth had by this time ceased
to settle over Ottalie's face.  On the grave, loosely tied
with rushes, was a bunch of dog-roses.
</p>

<p>
They climbed the sharp rise beyond the bridge.
Here they began to ride.  They were going to ride
thirty miles to the hotel.  There they would sleep.  In
the morning Roger would take the steamer and return
to London, where he would dree his weird by his lane
as best he could.
</p>

<p>
The men on the quay were loading ore, as of old, into
a dirty Glasgow coaster.  One of them asked Roger
which team had won at the hurling.
</p>

<p>
They ploughed through the red mud churned by the
ore-carts.  The schooner lay bilged on the sand, as of
old, with one forlorn rope flogging the air.  One or two
golfers loafed with their attendant loafers on the links.
They rode past them.  Then on the long, straight,
eastward bearing road, which rounds Cam Point, they
began to hurry, having the wind from the glens behind
them.  Soon they were at the last gloomy angle from
which the familiar hills could be seen.  They rounded
it.  They passed the little turnpike.  A cutter yacht,
standing close inshore, bowed slowly under all sail
before them.  She lifted, poising, as the helm went down.
Her sails trembled into a great rippling shaking, then
steadied suddenly as the sheet checked.  A man aboard
her waved his hand to them, calling something.  They
spun downhill from the cutter.  Now they were passing
by a shore where the water broke on weed-covered
boulders.  From that point the road became more ugly
at each turn of the wheel.  It was the road to England.
</p>

<p>
They stopped at the posting-house so that a puncture
might be mended while they were at tea.  Tea was
served in a long, damp, decaying room, hung with
shabby stuff curtains.  Vividly coloured portraits of
Queen Victoria and Robert Emmet hung from the
walls.  On the sideboard were many metal teapots.
On the table, copies of <i>Commerce</i>, each surmounted by
a time-table in a hard red cover, surrounded a tray of
pink wineglasses grouped about an aspodesta.  On a
piano was a pile of magazines, some of them ten years
old, all coverless and dog's-eared.  Roger picked up one
of the newest of them, not because he wanted to read
it, but because, like many literary men, he was unable
to keep his hands off printed matter.  He answered
Leslie at random as he looked through it.  There was
not much to interest him there.  Towards the end of it
there was a photograph of an African hut, against which
a man and woman huddled, apparently asleep.  A
white man in tropical clothes stood beside them, looking
at something in a sort of test-tube.
</p>

<p>
"A COMMON SCENE IN THE SLEEPING SICKNESS
BELT," ran the legend.  Underneath, in smaller type,
was written, "This photograph represents two natives
in the last stages of the dread disease, which, at present,
is believed to be incurable.  The man in white, to l. of
the picture (reader's r.), is Dr. Wanklyn, of the
Un. Kgdm. Med. Assn.  The photograph was taken by
Mr. A. S. Smallpiece, Dr. Wanklyn's assistant.  Copyright."
</p>

<p>
"What do you know of sleeping sickness, Leslie?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Sleeping sickness?" said Leslie.  "There was an
article about it in <i>The Fortnightly</i>, or one of the
reviews.  There was a theory that it is caused in some
way by the bite of a tsetse fly."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Roger, "I remember that."
</p>

<p>
"Then when Maggie and I were staying at Drumnalorry
we met old Dr. MacKenzie.  He was out in
Africa a great deal, fifty or sixty years ago.  He was a
great friend of my mother's.  He told us at dinner one
night that sleeping sickness is not a new thing at all,
but a very old thing.  The natives used to get it even
in his day.  He said that the tsetse fly theory was really
all nonsense.  He called it a pure invention, based on
the discovery that yellow fever is spread by the
white-ribbed mosquito.  His own theory was that it was
caused by manioc intoxication."
</p>

<p>
"That seems to me to be the prejudice of an old man.
What is manioc?"
</p>

<p>
"A kind of a root, like cassava, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Probably.  What is cassava?"
</p>

<p>
"It's what they make bread of; cassava bread.  It's
poisonous until you bake it.  Isn't that the stuff?
Are you interested in sleeping sickness?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It has been running in my head all day.
Look here.  Here's a picture of two Africans suffering
from it.  Do they just sleep away like that?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so.  They become more and more lethargic,
probably, until at last they cannot be roused."
</p>

<p>
"How long are they in that condition?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe for weeks.  Poor fellows; it must be
ghastly to watch."
</p>

<p>
"There is no cure.  There's no cure for a lot of
things.  Tetanus, leprosy, cancer.  I wonder how it
begins.  You wake up feeling drowsy.  And then to feel
it coming on; and to have seen others ill with it.  And
to know at the beginning what you will have to go
through and become.  It must be ghastly."
</p>

<p>
"Here is tea," said Leslie.  "By the way, sleeping
sickness must be getting worse.  It attacks Europeans
sometimes.  MacKenzie said that in his time it never
did."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Roger, "Europeans have given enough
diseases to the Africans.  It is only fair that we should
take some in return."
</p>

<p>
They rode on slowly in the bright Irish twilight.
When they were near the end of their journey they came
to a villa, the garden of which was shut from the road
by a low hedge.  The garden was full of people.  Some
of them were still playing croquet.  Chinese lanterns,
already lit, made mellow colour in the dusk.  A
black-haired, moustachioed man with a banjo sat in a
deck-chair singing.  The voice was a fine bass voice,
somehow familiar to Roger.  It was wailing out the end of a
sentimental ditty:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O, the moon, the moon, the moon,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
in which the expression had to supply the want of
intensity in the writing.  Hardly had the singer whined
his last note when he twanged his banjo thrice in a
sprightly fashion.  He piped up another ditty just as
the cyclists passed.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O, I'm so seedy,<br />
  So very seedy,<br />
  I don't know what to do.<br />
  I've consumption of the liver<br />
  And a dose of yellow fever<br />
  And sleeping sickness, too.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, my head aches<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my heart..."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The banjo came to ground with a twang: the song
stopped.
</p>

<p>
"Fawcett!" the singer shouted; "Fawcett!  Come
in here.  Where are you going?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't stop," cried Leslie, over his shoulder.  He
turned to Roger.  "Let's get away," he said.
</p>

<p>
They rode hard for a few minutes.  "Who was
that?" Roger asked.  "I seemed to know his voice."
</p>

<p>
"It's a man called Maynwaring," said Leslie.  "I
don't think you've met him, have you?  He's in the
Navy.  He met us at a dance.  He proposed to Ottalie
about a year ago.  Now he has married one of those
pretty, silly doll-women, a regular officer's wife.  They
are not much liked here."
</p>

<p>
"Curious," said Roger; "he was singing about sleeping
sickness.  Somehow, I think I must have met him.
His voice seems so familiar."  He stopped suddenly,
thinking that the voice was the voice of the singer in his
dream.  "Yes," he said to himself.  "Yes.  It was."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later they were sliding down the long
hill to the hotel.

<p>
London was too full of memories.  He could
not get away from them.  He could not
empty his mind sufficiently to plan or execute
new work.  He was too near to his misery.  He had
been in town, now, for a month; but he had done
nothing.  He was engaged daily in trying to realise
that his old life had stopped.  If he thought at all he
thought as those stunned by grief always will, in
passages of poignant feeling.  His nights were often
sleepless.  When he slept he often dreamed that he was alone
in the night, looking into a lit room where Ottalie stood,
half-defined, under heavy robes.  Then he would wake
with a start to realise that he would never see any
trace of her again, beyond the few relics which he
possessed.
</p>

<p>
Only one little ray of light gave him hope.  He
wanted to rebuild his life for her.  He wanted to
become all that she would have liked him to become.  In
any case, whatever happened, he would have the
memory of her to guide him in all that he did.  But he
felt, every now and then, when he could feel at all
hopefully, that she was trying to help him to become
what she had longed for him to be.  He thought that
little chance happenings in life were signals from her
in the other world, or, if not signals, attempts to move
him, attempts to make him turn to her; things full of
significance if only he could interpret them.  He felt
that in some way she was trying to communicate.  It
was as though the telephone had broken.  It was as
though the speaker could not say her message directly;
but had to say it in fragments to erring, forgetful,
wayward messengers, who forgot and lost their
sequence.  They could only hint, stammeringly, at the
secret revealed to them.  He thought that she had sent
him some message about sleeping sickness, using the
torn page, the magazine, and the naval officer, as her
messengers.  There were those three little words from
her, romantic, like words heard in dream.  If they were
not from her, then they were none the less holy, they
were intimately bound with his last memories of her.
Often he would cry out in his misery that she might be
granted to come to him in dream to complete her message.
What did she want to say about sleeping sickness?
</p>

<p>
He could not guess.  He could only say to himself
that for some hidden reason that disease had been
brought to his notice at a time when he was morbidly
sensitive to impressions.  He spent many hours in the
British Museum studying that disease as closely as one
not trained to medical research could hope to do.  He
read the Reports of the Commission, various papers
in <i>The Lancet</i>, the works of Professor Ronald Ross and
Sir Patrick Manson, the summary of Low in Allbutt,
the deeply interesting articles in the <i>Journal of
Tropical Medicine</i>, and whatever articles he could find in
reviews and encyclopædias.
</p>

<p>
He called one day at the theatre office in answer to a
telegram from Falempin.  Falempin had something to
say to him.  He had flung down the glove to the
"peegs," he said, by keeping on <i>The Roman Matron</i> for
the usual weekly eight performances, in spite of the
Press and the public wrath.  For three weeks he had
played it to empty or abusive houses.  Then, at the
end of the third week, a man had written in a monthly
review that <i>The Roman Matron</i> was the only play of
the year, and that all other English plays then running
in London were so many symptoms of our national
rottenness.  The writer was not really moved by <i>The
Roman Matron</i>.  He was a town wit, trying to
irritate the public by praising what it disliked, and by
finding a moral death in all that it approved.  It may
be said of such that they cast bread upon the waters;
but the genius, as a rule, does not find it until many
days.  In this case, as the wit was at the moment the
fashion, his article was effectual from the day of its
publication.  The actors found one evening an
attentive, not quite empty house.  Three nights later the
piece went very well indeed.  On the fourth night they
were called.  By the end of the week <i>The Roman
Matron</i> was a success, playing to a full house.
</p>

<p>
"Naldrett," said Falempin, "I 'ave lost twelve
thousand pounds over your play.  What so?  I go to make
perhaps forty thousand.  Always back your cards.
The peegs they will eat whatever they are told.  Some
of the papers they are eating their words.  You see?
Here; here is anozzer.  By the same men, I think.
Criticism?  Next to the peegs, I do lof the critic.  It
likes not me, these funny men.  What is the English
people coming to?  You 'ave critics; you 'ave very fine
critics.  But they 'ave no power.  Zese men in zese
gutter rags&mdash;Pah.  We go to make you many
motor-cars out of zis play."
</p>

<p>
Leslie brought his wife to town a week later.  She
wished to consult an oculist.  Roger dined with them
the night after their arrival.
</p>

<p>
"Roger," said Leslie, "I want you to meet my
cousin, Mrs. Heseltine.  She wants you to dine with
her to-morrow night.  We said that we would bring you
if you were free.  I hope that you will come; she's such
a splendid person."
</p>

<p>
Roger said that he would go.
</p>

<p>
That evening he went to an At Home given in honour
of a great French poet who was staying in London.  He
had no wish to attend the function.  He went from a
sense of duty.  He went from a sense of what was due
to the guardian of intellect.  The At Home was in
Kensington, in a big and hideous house.  A line of
carriages stood by the kerb, each with its tortured horses
tossing their heads piteously against the bearing-reins.
Flunkeys with white, sensual faces stood at the door.
There was a glitter of varnish everywhere, from boots,
carriages, and polished metal.  There was not much
noise, except the champ-champing of the bits and the
spattering of foam.  Carriage doors slammed from time
to time.  Loafers insulted those who entered.  Women
and children, standing by the strip of baize upon the
sidewalk, muttered in awed hatred.
</p>

<p>
Roger went into a room jammed with jabberers.  In
the middle of the room there was a kind of circle, a sort
of pugilists' ring, in which the poet stood.  He was a
little stocky man, powerfully built.  He had a great
head, poised back on his shoulders so that his jaw
protruded aggressively.  It needed only one glance to see
that he was the one vital person in the room.  The big,
beefy, successful English novelists looked like bladders
beside him.  He talked in a voice which boomed and
rang.  People crowded up.  Ladies in wonderful frocks
broke on him, as it were, in successions of waves.  He
bowed, he was shaken by the hand, he was pulled by the
arm.  Questions and compliments and platitudes came
upon him in every known variety of indifferent French.
He never ceased to talk.  He could have talked the
room to a standstill, and gone on fresh to a dozen like
it.  He was talking wisely, too.  Roger heard half of
one booming epigram as he caught his hostess' eye.  She
was bringing up relays of platitudes to take the place of
those already exploded.  His host, sawing the air with
one hand, was expounding something which he couldn't
explain.  Roger saw him compliment the poet for
taking his point without exposition.  Exploded platitudes
ran into Roger and apologised.  Roger ran into
platitudes not yet exploded and apologised.  There was a
gabble everywhere of unintelligent talk, dominating but
not silencing the great voice.  Roger heard an elegant
young man speak of the poet as "a bounder, an awful
bounder."  Then somebody took him by the arm.
Somebody wanted to talk to him.  He said his say to
the great man while being dragged to somebody.
Somebody in a strange kind of chiton below a strange
old gold Greek necklace was telling him about <i>The
Roman Matron</i>.  Did he write it?
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said.  "I wrote it."
</p>

<p>
The hostess interposed.  The chiton was borne off to
a lady in Early Victorian dress.  A little grey man,
very erect and wiry, like a colonel on the stage, bumped
into Roger.
</p>

<p>
"Rather a crowd, eh?" he said, as he apologised.
"Have you seen my wife anywhere?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Roger.  "Is she here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the other.  "I believe she is.  Awfully
well the old fellow looks, doesn't he?  I met him in
Paris in 1890."
</p>

<p>
They talked animatedly for ten minutes about the
prospects of French literature as compared with our
own.  Presently the little man caught sight of his wife.
He nodded to Roger and passed on.  Roger could not
remember that he had ever seen him before.
</p>

<p>
He looked about for some one with whom to talk.  A
couple of novelists stood on the opposite side of the
room talking to a girl.  There was not much chance of
getting to them.  He looked to his left hand, where
some of the waste of the party had been drifted by the
tide.  He did not know any of the people there.  He
was struck by the appearance of a young man who stood
near the wall, watching the scene with an interest which
was half contemptuous.  The man was, perhaps, thirty
years of age.  What struck Roger about him was the
strange yellowness of his face.  The face looked as
though it had been varnished with a clear amber
varnish.  The skin near the eyes was puckered into crows'
feet.  The brow was wrinkled and seamed.  The rest
of the face had the leanness and tightness of one who
has lived much in unhealthy parts of the tropics.  He
was a big man, though as lean as a rake.  Roger judged
from his bearing that he had been a soldier; yet there
was a touch of the doctor about him, too.  His eyes
had the direct questioning look of one always alert to
note small symptoms, and to find the truth of facts
through evasions and deceits.  His hands were large,
capable, clinical hands, with long, supple, sensitive
fingers, broad at the tips.  The mouth was good-humoured,
but marred by the scar of a cut at the left corner.
</p>

<p>
Presently the man walked up to Roger with the
inimitable easy grace which is in the movements of men
who live much in the open.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me," he said; "but who is the poet in the
middle there?"
</p>

<p>
"Jerome Mongeron," said Roger.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," said the man, retiring.
</p>

<p>
Roger noticed that the man's eyes were more bloodshot
than any eyes he had ever seen.  Soon after that
Roger saw him lead an elderly lady, evidently his
mother, out of the room.  As he felt that he had bored
himself sufficiently in homage to the man of intellect,
he too slipped away as soon as he could.
</p>

<p>
The night following he dined with Mrs. Heseltine.
She was an elderly lady, fragile-looking, but very
beautiful, with that autumnal beauty which comes with the
beginning greyness of the hair.  Her face had the fineness
of race in it.  Looking at her, one saw that all the
unwanted, unlovely elements had been bred away, by
conscious selection, in many generations of Fawcetts.
Her face had that simple refinement of feature which
one sees in the women's faces in Holbein's drawing of
Sir Thomas More's family.  Only in Mrs. Heseltine
the striving for rightness and fineness had been pushed
a little too far at the expense of the bodily structure.
There was a pathetic drooping of the mouth's corners,
and a wild-bird look in the eye which told of physical
weakness very bravely borne.  Her husband was a brain
specialist.
</p>

<p>
She wore black for her niece.  There were few other
guests.  It was a family party.  There were the two
Heseltines, their cousins the Luscombes, the two
Fawcetts, Ethel Fawcett (another cousin), a woman in
morning dress who had just been speaking at a suffrage
meeting, Roger, and one Lionel who was very late.
They waited for Lionel.  They were sure that Lionel
would not be long.  The suffrage speaker, Miss Lenning,
asked if Lionel were better.  Yes.  The new treatment
was doing him good.  They were hoping that he
would get over it.  Roger started when Mrs. Heseltine's
voice grew grave.  There were notes in it
strangely like Ottalie's voice.  The voice reveals
character more clearly than the face, more clearly than it
reveals character, it reveals spiritual power.  Until he
heard those grave notes he had not seen much of Ottalie
in her, except in the way in which she sat, the head
a little drooped, the hands composed, in a pose which
no art could quite describe, it was so like her.  The
words thrilled through him, as though the dead were
in the room under a disguise.  There was Leslie looking
at him, with grave, kindly deliberation, putting up
his glasses to Ottalie's eyes with Ottalie's hand.
Ottalie's voice spoke to him through Mrs. Heseltine.
They were away in one corner of the room now,
looking at a drawing.
</p>

<p>
"I have so often heard of you," she was saying.
"Somehow I always missed you when I was at Portobe.
But I have heard of you from Leslie, and from poor
Ottalie.  I wanted to see you.  I have been waiting to
see you for the last month.  I wanted to tell you
something which Ottalie said to me, when my boy was killed
in the war.  She said that when a life ended, like that,
suddenly and incomplete, it was our task to complete
it, for the world's sake, in our own lives."  She paused
for an instant, and then added: "I have tried to
realise what my boy would have done.  I hope that you
will come to talk to me whenever you like.  Ottalie was
very dear to me.  She was in this room, looking at this
drawing, only seven weeks ago."  She faltered for a
moment.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mrs. Heseltine?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Talking about you," she added gently.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Heseltine," said the maid, opening the door.
The man with the yellow face and injected eyes entered.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Lionel," said Mrs. Heseltine.
</p>

<p>
"I'm awfully sorry I'm so late," he said.  "They've
been trying a new cure on me.  It's said to be permanent;
but they've only tried it on one other fellow so far.
I wish you hadn't waited for me."  He glanced at
Roger with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"D'you know Mr. Heseltine, Mr. Naldrett?"
</p>

<p>
"We met each other last night," said Roger.  "At
the MacElherans'."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I think we did," he answered.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was announced.  Roger took Miss Lenning.
Mrs. Heseltine sat at his left.  Miss Lenning was a
determined young woman with no nonsense about her.
Roger asked if her speech had gone well.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty well," she said.  "I was on a wagon in the
Park.  A lot of loafers rushed the wagon once or twice.
It's the sort of thing London loafers delight to do."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Roger.  "That is because the part of
London near the parks is not serious.  It is a part given
up to pleasure-mongers and their parasites.  The
crowds there don't believe in anything, they won't help
anything, they can't understand anything.  In the East
of London you would probably get attention.  I suppose
the police sniggered and looked away?"
</p>

<p>
"You talk as though you had been at it yourself,"
said Miss Lenning.
</p>

<p>
"Been at it?  Yes.  Of course I have.  But not
very much, I'm afraid.  I used to speak fairly
regularly.  Then at your big meeting in the Park I got a
rotten egg in the jaw, which gave me blood poisoning.
I had to stop then, because ever since then I've been
behindhand with my work.  A London crowd is a crowd
of loafers loafing.  But a crowd in a northern city,
in Manchester, or Leeds, or Glasgow, is a very different
thing.  They are a different stock.  They are working
men, interested in things.  Here they are idlers
delighting in a chance of rowdyism.  They are without
chivalry or decent feeling.  They go to boo and jeer,
knowing that the police won't stop them.  I think you
women are perfectly splendid to do what you do, and
have done."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, one doesn't mind going to prison," said Miss
Lenning.  "I've been three times now.  Besides, we
shall know how to reform the prisons when we get the
vote.  What makes my blood boil are the insults I get
in the streets from the sort of men whose votes are
responsible for disgraces like the war."  She stopped.
"What is your line?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a writer."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you write a play or a novel about us?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I don't believe in mixing art with
propaganda.  My province is to induce emotion.  I am not
going to use such talent as I have upon intellectual
puzzles proper to this time.  This is the work of a
reformer or a leader-writer.  My work is to find out
certain general truths in nature, and to express them, in
prose or verse, in as high and living a manner as I can.
That seems absurd to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not absurd exactly," she said, "but selfish."
</p>

<p>
"You think, then, that a man who passes his life in
trying to make the world's thought nobler, and the
world's character thereby finer, must necessarily be
selfish?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I do," she said firmly.  "There are all you
writers trying, as you put it, to make the world's
thought noble, and not one of you&mdash;I beg your pardon,
only three of you&mdash;lift a finger to help us get the vote.
You don't really care a rush about the world's thought.
You care only for your own thought."
</p>

<p>
"And your own thought isn't thought at all," said
Major Luscombe from over the table.  "I don't mean
yours, personally, of course.  I like your play very
much.  But taking writers generally throughout the
world, what does the literary mind contribute to the
world's thought now?  Can you point to any one writer,
anywhere in the world, whose thoughts about the world
are really worth reading?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  To a good many.  In a good many countries,"
said Roger.
</p>

<p>
"I have no quarrel with art," said Heseltine, taking
up the cudgels.  "It is moral occupation.  But I feel
this about modern artists, that, with a few exceptions,
they throw down no roots, either into national or private
life.  They care no more for the State, in its religious
sense, than they care (as, say, an Elizabethan would
have cared) for conduct.  They seem to me to be a
company of men without any common principle or joint
enthusiasm, working, rather blindly and narrowly, at
the bidding of personal idiosyncrasy, or of some
aberration of taste.  A few of you, some of the most
determined, are interested in social reform.  The rest of you
are merely photographing what goes on for the amusement
of those who cannot photograph."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Roger.  "At present you are condemning
modern society.  When you were a boy, Dr. Heseltine,
you lived in an ordered world, which was governed
by supernatural religion, excited by many material
discoveries, and kept from outward anxiety by prosperity
and peace.  All that world has been turned topsy-turvy
in one generation.  We are no longer an ordered world.
I believe there is a kind of bacillus, isn't there, which,
when exposed to the open air, away from its home in the
blood, flies about wildly in all directions?  That is what
we are doing.  A large proportion of English people,
having lost faith in their old ruler, supernatural
religion, fly about wildly in motor-cars.  And,
unfortunately, material prosperity has increased enormously
while moral discipline has been declining; so that now,
while we are, perhaps, at the height of our national
prosperity, there is practically no common enthusiasm
binding man to man, spirit to spirit.  It is difficult for
an artist to do much more than to reflect the moral
conduct of his time, and to cleanse, as it were, what is
eternal in conduct from its temporary setting.  If the world
maintains, as I hold that it does, that there is nothing
eternal, and that moral conduct consists in going a great
deal, very swiftly, in many very expensive motor-cars,
with as many idle companions as possible, then I maintain
that you must respect the artist for standing alone
and working, as you put it, 'rather blindly and
narrowly,' at whatever protest his personal idiosyncrasy
urges him to make."
</p>

<p>
"That's just what I was saying," said Major
Luscombe.  "I was dining with Sir Herbert Chard last
night, down at Aldershot.  We were talking military
shop rather.  About conscription.  I said that I
thought it was a great pity that universal discipline of
some kind had not been substituted for the old moral
discipline, which of course we all remember, and I dare
say were the last to get.  You can't get on without
discipline."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but that is preaching militarism," said
Mrs. Heseltine; "and preaching it insidiously."
</p>

<p>
"The military virtues are the bed-rock of character,"
said the Major.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot believe that character is taught by
drill-sergeants and subalterns," said Mrs. Heseltine.  "If it
is taught at all, it is taught (perhaps unconsciously) by
fine men and women; and to some extent by the images
of noble character in works of art.  I see no chance of
moral regeneration in conscription, only another excuse
for vapouring, and for that kind of casting off of
judgment and responsibility which goes under the name of
patriotism."
</p>

<p>
"I would rather establish a compulsory study of
Equity," said Roger.  "Then nations might judge a
<i>casus belli</i> justly, on its merits, instead of accepting the
words of newspapers inspired by unscrupulous usurers,
as at present.  A few unprincipled men, mostly of the
lowest kind of commercial Jew, are able to run this
country into war whenever they like.  And the Briton
believes himself to be a level-headed business man."
</p>

<p>
"If that is the case," said the Major triumphantly,
"it proves my point.  If we are likely to go to war, we
ought to be prepared for war.  And we can only be
prepared if we establish conscription.  And if we are
not prepared, we shall cease as a nation.  It is your
duty, as an English writer, to awaken the national
conscience by a play or novel, so that when the time comes
we may be prepared."
</p>

<p>
"My duty is nothing of the kind," said Roger.  "I
believe war to be a wasteful curse; and the preparation
for war to be an even greater curse, and infinitely more
wasteful.  I am not a patriot, remember.  My State is
mind.  The human mind.  I owe allegiance to that
first.  I am not going to set Time's clock back by
preaching war.  War belongs to savages and to obsolete
anachronisms like generals.  You think that that is
decadence.  That I am a weak, spiritless, little-Englander,
who will be swept away by the first 'still, strong
man' who comes along with 'a mailed fist.'  Very well.
I have no doubt that brute force can and will sweep
away most things not brutal like itself.  It may sweep
me away.  But I will not disgrace my century by
preaching the methods of Palæolithic man.  If you
want war, go out and fight waste.  I suppose that two
hundred and fifty million pounds are flung away each
year on drink and armaments in this country alone.  I
suppose that in the same time about five hundred
pounds are spent on researches into the causes of
disease.  About the same amount is given away to reward
intellectual labours.  I mean labours not connected
with the improvement of beer or dynamite.  Such
labours as noble imaginings about the world and life."  He
looked at Miss Lenning, whose eye was kindling.
No one who has dabbled in politics can resist rhetoric
of any kind.
</p>

<p>
"You send women to prison for wanting to control
such folly," he went on.  "Doesn't he, Miss Lenning?
If I am to become a propagandist, I will do so in the
cause of liberty or knowledge.  I would write for Miss
Lenning, or for Dr. Heseltine there, but for a military
man, who merely wants food for powder, for no grand,
creative principle, I would not write even if the
Nicaraguans were battering St. Paul's."
</p>

<p>
"Some day," said Mrs. Heseltine, "we may become
great enough to give up all this idea of Empire, and set
out, like the French, to lead the world in thought and
manners.  We might achieve something then.  France
was defeated.  She is now the most prosperous and the
most civilised country in the world."
</p>

<p>
"And the least vital," said the Major's wife.
</p>

<p>
"But what do you mean by vital?" said Roger,
guessing that she was repeating a class catch-word.
"Vitality is shewn by a capacity for thought."
</p>

<p>
Maggie Fawcett interposed.  "It's a very curious
state of things," said she.  "The intellect of the world
is either trading, fighting for trade, or preparing to
fight for trade.  It is, in any case, pursuing a definite
object.  But the imagination of the world is engaged in
finding a stable faith to replace the old one.  It is
wavering between science and superstition, neither of
which will allow a compromise.  You, Mr. Naldrett, if
you will excuse my saying so, belong to the superstition
camp.  You believe that a man is in a state of grace if
he goes to a tragedy, and can tell a Francesca from a
Signorelli.  I belong to the science camp, and I believe
that that camp is going to win.  It's attracting the
better kind of person; and it has an enthusiasm which
yours has not.  You are looking for an indefinite, rare,
emotional state, in which you can apprehend the moral
relations of things.  We are looking for the material
relations of things so that the rare emotional state can
be apprehended, not by rare, peculiar people, such as
men of genius, but by everybody."
</p>

<p>
"What you had better do," said Dr. Heseltine, "is,
give up all this 'obsolete anachronism' of art.  Science
is the art of the twentieth century.  You cannot paint
or write in the grand manner any longer.  That has all
been done.  Men like you ought to be stamping out
preventable disease.  Instead of that, you are writing
of what Tom said to James while Dick fell in the water.
With a fortieth part of what is wasted annually on the
army alone, I would undertake to stamp out phthisis in
these islands.  With another fortieth part there is very
little doubt that cancer could be stamped out too.
With another fortieth part, wisely and scientifically
administered without morbid sentiment, we could stamp
out crime and other mental diseases."
</p>

<p>
"The motor-car and golf, for instance?" said Ethel
Fawcett.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  And betting, 'sport,' war, idleness, drink,
vice, tobacco, tea, all the abominations of life.  All the
reversions to incompleted types.  You ought to write
a play or a novel on these things.  I'm not speaking
wildly.  I'm speaking of a proved scientific possibility
of relative human perfection.  When life has been made
glorious, as I can see that it could be made, then you
artists could set to work to decorate it as much as you
like."
</p>

<p>
"So, then," said Roger, "there are three ways to
perfection, by admitting women to the suffrage, by
driving men into the army, and by substituting the
College of Surgeons for the Government.  Now an
artist is concerned above all things with moral ideas.  He
is not limited, or should not be, to particular truths.
His world is the entire world, reduced, by strict and
passionate thinking, to its imaginative essence.  You
and your schemes, and their relative importance, are my
study, and, when I have reduced them to the ideas of
progress which they embody, my material.  I think that
you have all made the search for perfection too much
a question of profession.  It is not a question of
profession.  It is a question of personal character."  After
a short pause he went on.  "At the same time,
there is nothing the man of thought desires so much as
to be a man of action.  English writers (I suppose from
their way of bringing up) have been much tempted to
action.  Byron went liberating Greece.  Chaucer was
an ambassador, Spenser a sort of Irish R.M., Shakespeare
an actor-manager and money-lender, or, as some
think, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  Writing alone
is not enough for a man."
</p>

<p>
Leslie, who had been chatting to Ethel Fawcett,
looked at Roger without speaking.  Dinner came slowly
to an end.  The ladies left the room.  The men settled
into their chairs.  Dr. Heseltine moved the port to
Lionel, with, "I suppose you're not allowed this?"
</p>

<p>
Lionel refused the port, smiling.  He put a white
tabloid into a little soda-water and settled into the
chair next to Roger.  He pulled out his cigarette case.
"Will you smoke?" he asked.  "These are rather a
queer kind."
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks," said Roger.  "I've given it up."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I could do that," said Lionel, selecting
a strange-looking cigarette done up in yellow paper,
with twisted ends.  "I smoke a good deal.  When one's
alone one wants tobacco; one gets into the way of it."
</p>

<p>
He lit a cigarette with a brown hand which trembled.
Roger, noticing the tremor, and the redness of the man's
eyes, wondered if he were a secret drinker.  "Are you
much alone?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"A good deal," Lionel answered.  "I've just been
reading a book by you; it's called <i>The Handful</i>.  I
think you wrote it, didn't you?  So you've been in the
tropics, too?"
</p>

<p>
"I went to stay with an uncle at Belize, five years
ago," said Roger.  "I only stayed for about a month."
</p>

<p>
"Belize," said Lionel.  "My chief was in Belize.
Was there any yellow fever there, when you were
there?"
</p>

<p>
"There was one case," said Roger.
</p>

<p>
"Did you see it?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Roger; "I didn't."
</p>

<p>
"I should like to see yellow fever," said Lionel simply.
"I suppose there was a good deal of fuss directly
this case occurred?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Roger.  "A gang came round at once.
I think they put paraffin in the cisterns.  They sealed
the infected house with brown paper and fumigated it."
</p>

<p>
"And that stopped it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  There were no other cases."
</p>

<p>
"It's all due to a kind of mosquito," said Lionel.
"The white-ribbed mosquito.  He carries the organism.
You put paraffin on all standing puddles and
pools to prevent the mosquito's larvæ from hatching out.
My old chief did a lot of work in Havana, and the
West Indies, stampin' out yellow fever.  It has made
the Panama Canal possible."
</p>

<p>
"Are you a doctor, then, may I ask?" said Roger.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Lionel.  "I do medical research work;
but I don't know much about it.  I never properly
qualified.  I'm interested in all that kind of thing."
</p>

<p>
"What medical research do you do?  Would it bore
you to tell me?"
</p>

<p>
"I have been out in Uganda, doing sleeping sickness."
</p>

<p>
"Have you?" said Roger.  "That's very interesting.
I've been reading a lot of books about sleeping
sickness."
</p>

<p>
"Are you interested in that kind of thing?" Lionel
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"If you care to come round to my rooms some time
I would shew you some relics.  I live in Pump Court.
I'm generally in all the morning, and between four and
six in the evening.  I could shew you some trypanosomes.
They're the organisms."
</p>

<p>
"What are they like?" Roger asked.
</p>

<p>
"They're like little wriggly flattened membranes.
Some of them have tails.  They multiply by longitudinal
division.  They're unlike anything else.  They've
got a pretty bad name."
</p>

<p>
"And they cause the disease?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  You know, of course, that they are spread
by the tsetse fly?  The tsetse fly sucks them out of an
infected fish or mammal, and develops them, inside his
body probably for some time, during which the organism
probably changes a good deal.  When the tsetse
bites a man, the developed trypanosome gets down the
proboscis into the blood.  About a week after the bite,
when the bite itself is cured, the man gets the ordinary
trypanosome fever, which makes you pretty wretched,
by the way."
</p>

<p>
"Have you had it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; rather.  I have it now.  It recurs at intervals."
</p>

<p>
"And how about sleeping sickness?"
</p>

<p>
"You get sleeping sickness when the trypanosome
enters the cerebro-spinal fluid.  You may not get it for
six or seven years after the bite.  On the other hand,
you may get it almost at once."
</p>

<p>
"Then you may get it?" said Roger, startled, looking
at the man with a respect which was half pity.
</p>

<p>
"I've got it," said Lionel.
</p>

<p>
"Got it?  You?" said Roger.  He stumbled in his
speech.  "But, forgive my speaking like this," he said;
"is there a cure, then?"
</p>

<p>
"It's not certain that it's a permanent cure," said
Lionel.  "I've just started it.  It's called atoxyl.
Before I tried atoxyl I had another thing called
trypanroth, made out of aniline dye.  It has made my eyes
red, you see?  Dyed them.  You can have 'em dyed
blue, if you prefer.  But red was good enough, I
thought.  Now I'm afraid I'm talking rather about
myself."
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed; I'm intensely interested," said Roger.
"Tell me more.  Tell me about the sickness in Uganda.
Is it really bad?"
</p>

<p>
"Pretty bad," said Lionel.  "I suppose that a couple
of hundred thousand men and women have died of it
during the last seven years.  I don't know how many
animals besides.  The tsetse will bite pretty nearly
every living thing, and everything it bites gets disease
of some sort.  You see, trypanosomiasis is probably a
new thing in Uganda.  New diseases are often very
deadly, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"Is the tsetse migrating, then, or can the thing be
conveyed by contagion?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I don't think it's a contagious thing.  I
should say it almost certainly isn't.  It needs direct
inoculation.  And as far as we know the tsetse keeps
pretty near to one place all through its life."
</p>

<p>
"I know a writer who claims that we are spreading
it.  Is that so?"
</p>

<p>
"Indirectly.  You see, East Africa is not like America
or any other horse country.  You haven't got much
means of transport, except bearers, unless you go by
river, and even then you may have to make portages.
Going with natives from one district to another is sure
to spread the infection.  When infected people come to
a healthy district, their germs are sure to be inoculated
into the healthy by some tick or bug, even if there are
no tsetses to do it.  I believe there are trypanosomes
in the hut-bugs.  I don't know, though, that hut-bugs
are guiltier than any other kind.  It's impossible to
say.  From the hour you land until the hour you sail,
you are always being bitten or stung by something.
Bugs, ticks, fleas, lice, mosquitoes, tsetses, ants, jiggers,
gads, hippos, sandflies, wasps.  You put on oil of
lavender, if you have any.  But even with that you are
always being bitten."
</p>

<p>
"And what is the tsetse bite like?"
</p>

<p>
"You've been to Portobe, haven't you?  I remember
Ottalie Fawcett speaking of you, years ago, before I
went out.  You had that cottage at the very end of the
loaning, just above the sea?  Well.  Did you ever go
on along the cliff from there to a place where you have
to climb over a very difficult barbed-wire fence just
under an ash-tree?  I mean just before you come to a
nunnery ruin, where there is a little waterfall?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Roger.  "I know the exact spot.
There used to be a hawk's nest in the cliff just below the
barbed wire."
</p>

<p>
"Well, just there, there are a lot of those
reddy-grey flies called clegs.  You get them going up to
Essna-Lara.  That's another place.  They bite the horses.
You must have been bitten by them.  Well, a tsetse
is not much like a cleg to look at.  It's duller and
smaller.  It's likest to a house-fly, except for the wings,
which are unlike any other kind of insect wings.  It
comes at you not unlike a cleg.  You know how savage
a cleg is?  He dashes at you without any pretence.
He only feints when he is just going to land.  And he
follows you until you kill him.  A tsetse is like that.
He'll follow you for half a mile, giving you no peace.
Like a cleg, he settles down on you very gently, so that
you don't notice him.  You'll remember the mosquitoes
at Belize.  Mosquitoes are like that.  Then, when he
has sucked his fill and unscrewed his gimlet, you feel a
smarting itch, and see your hand swollen.  If you are
not very well at the time a tsetse bite can be pretty
bad.  If you'll come to my rooms some time I'll show
you some tsetse.  They're nothing to look at.  They're
very like common house-flies."
</p>

<p>
"And you have been studying all this on the spot?
Will you tell me what made you take to it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I was always interested in that kind of thing.
I've always liked hot climates, and being in wild, lonely
places.  And then my old chief was a splendid fellow.
He made me interested.  I got awfully keen on it.  I
want to go out again.  You know, I want to get at
the bottom of the trypanosome.  His life-history isn't
known yet, as we know the cycle of the malaria
parasite.  We don't even know what it is in him which
causes the disease.  And we don't know very much
really about the tsetse, nor what part the tsetse plays in
the organism's life.  There's a lot which I should like
to find out, or try to find out.  It's the trying which
gives one the pleasure."
</p>

<p>
"But I think it's heroic of you," said Roger.  "Are
there many of you out there, doing this?"
</p>

<p>
"Not very many."
</p>

<p>
"It's a heroic thing to do," said Roger.  "Heroic.
The loneliness alone must make it heroic."
</p>

<p>
"You get used to the loneliness.  It gives you nerves
at first.  But in my opinion the heat keeps you from
thinking much about the loneliness.  I like heat myself,
but it takes it out of most of the griffs.  The heat can
be pretty bad."
</p>

<p>
"All the same, it is a wonderful thing to do."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It's a good thing to spot the cause of a disease
like that.  But you over-rate the heroic part.  It's
all in the day's work.  One takes it as it comes, and
one has a pretty good time, too.  One never thinks of
the risk, which is really very slight.  Doctors face
worse things in London every day.  So do nurses.  A
doctor was telling me only the other day how a
succession of nurses went down to a typhus epidemic and
died one after the other.  There's nothing like that in
the Protectorate with sleeping sickness."
</p>

<p>
"But being the only white man, away in the wilds,
with the natives dying all round you!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  That is pretty bad.  I was in the middle of
a pretty bad outbreak in a little place called Ikupu.  It
was rather an interesting epidemic, because it
happened in a place where there weren't any of the tsetse
which is supposed to do the harm.  They may have
been there; but I couldn't find any.  It must have
been another kind which did the damage at Ikupu.  As
a matter of fact, I did find trypanosomes in another
kind there, which was rather a feather in my cap.
Well, I was alone there.  My assistant died of
blackwater fever.  And there I was with a sleeping village.
There were about twenty cases.  Most of the rest of
the natives ran away, and no doubt spread the
infection.  Those twenty cases were pretty nearly all the
society of Ikupu.  Some were hardly ill at all.  They
just had a little fever, perhaps, or a skin complaint on
the chest, and tender, swollen glands.  Others were just
as bad as they could be.  They were in all stages of the
disease.  Some were just beginning to mope outside
their huts.  Others were sitting still there, not even
caring to ask for food, just moping away to death, with
their mouths open.  Generally, one gets used to
seeing that sort of thing; but I got nerves that time.  You
see, they were rather a special tribe at Ikupu.  They
called themselves Obmali, or some such name.  Their
lingo was rather rummy.  Talking with the chief I
got the impression that they were the relics of a tribe
which had been wiped out further west.  They believed
that sleeping sickness was caused by a snake-woman in
a swampy part of the forest.  Looking after all those
twenty people, and taking tests from them, gave me
fever a good deal.  That is one thing you have to get
used to&mdash;fever.  You get used to doing your work
with a temperature of one hundred and two degrees.
It's queer about fever.  Any start, or shock, or extra
work, may bring it on you.  I had it, as I said, a good
deal.  Well, I got into the way of thinking that there
was a snake-woman.  A woman with a puff-adder head,
all mottled.  I used to barricade my hut at night
against her."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Heseltine drew his chair up.  "What are you
two discussing?  Talking about sleeping sickness?" he
asked.  "How does the new treatment suit you,
Lionel?  No headache, I hope?  It's apt to make you
headachy.  There's a subject for a play for you,
Mr. Naldrett.  'Man and the Trypanosome.'  You could
bring the germs on to the stage, and kill them off with
a hypodermic syringe."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Roger.  "It has all the requirements of
a modern play: strength, silence, and masculinity.
There's even a happy ending to it."
</p>

<p>
Lionel began to talk to Dr. Heseltine.  Roger crossed
the room to talk to Leslie.  He heard Lionel saying
something about "waiting to give the monkey a chance."  He
did not get another talk with Lionel that night.
After they joined the ladies, Ethel Fawcett sang.  She
had a good, but not very strong voice.  She sang some
Schumann which had been very dear to Ottalie.  Her
voice was a little like Ottalie's in the high notes.  It
haunted Roger all the way home, and into his lonely
room.  Sitting down before the fireplace he had a
sudden vision of drenching wet grass, and a tangle of
yellowing honeysuckle, heaped over a brook which gurgled.
For an instant he had the complete illusion of the smell
of meadowsweet, and Ottalie coming singing from the
house, so sharply that he gasped.

<p>
The next morning he found upon his plate a
letter in a strange hand.  The writing was
firmly formed, but ugly.  The letters had a
way of lying down upon each other towards the end of
each word.  It was not a literary hand.  It was from
Lionel Heseltine.

<p>
"If you would like to see my relics, will you
come round next Thursday to my rooms between 4 and

<p class="noindent">
  "Yours sincerely,<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He replied that he would gladly join him there on
Thursday.  He wished that Thursday were not still six
days away.  He was drawn to all these people who had
known Ottalie.  They were parts of her life.  He
realised now how much people must be in a woman's life.
A man has work, and the busy interests created by it.
A woman has friends and the emotions roused by them.
This world of Ottalie's friends was new to him.  He
tried to look upon them as she would have looked upon
them.  These had known her intimately since her
childhood.  They had been in her mind continually.  She
had lived with them.  He had often felt vaguely jealous
of them, when he had heard her talk of them with
Agatha; or if not jealous, sad, that he should not have
access to that side of her.
</p>

<p>
He was drawn to them all, but Lionel attracted him
the most strongly.  Some of his liking for Lionel was
mere instinctive recognition of an inherent fineness and
simplicity in the man's character.  But there was more
than that.  He had often felt that in life, as in nature,
there is a constant effort to remedy the unnatural.  The
inscrutable agency behind life offers always wisely some
restoration or readjustment of a balance disturbed.  He
felt that a tide had quickened in his life, at the last
ebbing of the old.  In the old life all had been to please
Ottalie.  Life was more serious now.  He could not go
back all at once to a life interrupted as his had been.
Life was not what he had thought it.  In the old days
it had sufficed to brood upon beautiful images, till his
mind had reflected them clearly enough for his hand to
write down their evocative symbols.  He was not too
young to perceive the austerer beauty in the room of
life beyond the room in which youth takes his pleasure.
But so far his life had been so little serious that he
had lacked the opportunity of perceiving it.  Now the
old world of the beauty of external image, well-defined
and richly coloured, was shattered for him.  He saw
how ugly a thing it was, even as a plaything or
decoration, beside the high and tragical things of life and
death.  It was his misfortune to have lived a life
without deep emotions.  Now that sorrows came upon him
together, smiting him mercilessly, it was his misfortune
to be without a friend capable of realising what the
issue warring in him meant.  O'Neill had sent him a
note from Ubrique in Andaluz, asking him to order a
supply of litharge for his experiments, which were
"wonderful."  Pollock had sent him a note from
Lyme, repaying, "with many, many thanks," the loan
of fifty guineas.  His "little girl was very well, and
Kitty was wonderful."  Besides these two he had no
other intimate friends.  Leslie, a much finer person
than either of them, might have understood and helped
his mood; but Leslie had been away in Ireland since
the first fortnight.  Being, therefore, much alone in
his misery, Roger had come to look upon himself in
London as the one sentient, tortured thing in a callous
ant-swarm.  He was shrinking from the sharp points
of contact with the world on to still sharper internal
points of dissatisfaction with himself.  It was, therefore,
natural that he should be strongly attracted by
a man who carried a mortal disease, with a grave and
cheerful spirit, serenely smiling, able, even in this last
misfortune, to feel that life had been ordered well, in
accordance with high law.  The more he thought of
Lionel, the more he came to envy that life of mingled
action and thought which had tempered such a spirit.
In moments of self-despising he saw, or thought that he
saw, this difference between their lives.  He himself
was like an old king surprised by death in the
treasure-house.  He had piled up many jewels of many-gleaming
thought; he was robed in purple; his brain was
heavy from the crown's weight.  And all of it was a
heavy uselessness.  He could take away none of it.
The treasure was all dust, rust, and rags.  He was a
weak and fumbling human soul shut away from his
bright beloved, not only by death, but by his own
swaddled insufficiency.  Lionel, on the other hand, was a
crusader, dying outside the Holy City, perhaps not in
sight of it, but so fired with the idea of it that death was
a little thing to him.  All his life had been death for
an idea.  All his life had made dying easier.  Roger's
tortured mind was not soothed by thinking how their
respective souls would look after death.  Some men
laid up treasures in heaven, others laid up treasures on
earth.  The writer, doubting one and despising the
other, laid up treasures in limbo.  He began to
understand O'Neill's remark that it was "the most difficult
thing in the world for an artist both to do good work and
to save his own soul."  Little, long-contemned scraps of
mediæval theology, acquired in the emotional mood
during which he had been pre-Raphaelite, appealed to him
again, suddenly, as not merely attractive but wise.
Often, at times of deep emotion, in the fear of death,
the mind finds more significance in things learned in
childhood than in the attainments of maturity.  This
emotion, the one real passionate emotion of his life, had
humbled him.  Life had suddenly shewn itself in its
primitive solemnity.  The old life was all ashes and
whirling dust.  He understood something, now, of the
conflict going on in life.  But he understood it
quakingly, as a prophet hears the voice in the night.  He
saw his own soul shrivelling like a leaf in the presence
of a great reality.  He had to establish that soul's
foundations before he could sit down again to work.  The
artist creates the image of his own soul.  When he sees
the insufficiency of that soul, he can either remedy it or
take to criticism.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Thinking over the talk of the night before, he
wondered at the train of events which had altered the course
of his thinking.  Lionel, a few weeks before, would
have been to him a charming, interesting, but
misguided man, wandering in one of those sandy,
sonorously named Desarts where William Blake puts Newton,
Locke, and those other fine intellects, with whom he
was not in sympathy.  Now he saw that Lionel was
ahead of him on the road.  Thinking of Lionel, and
wishing that he, too, had done something for his fellows,
he traced the course of a tide of affairs which had been
setting into his mind.  It had begun with that blowing
paper in the garden, as a beginning tide brings rubbish
with it.  Now it was in full flood with him, lifting
him over shallows where he had long lain grounded.
He began to doubt whether literature was so fine a thing
as he had thought.  Science, so cleanly and fearless,
was doing the poet's work, while the poet, taking his
cue from Blake, maligned her with the malignity of
ignorance.  What if poetry were a mere antique
survival, a pretty toy, which attracted the fine mind, and
held it in dalliance?  There were signs everywhere that
the day of <i>belles-lettres</i> was over.  Good intellects were
no longer encouraged to write, "pricked on by your
popes and kings."  More than that, good intellects were
less and less attracted to literature.  The revelation of
the age was scientific, not artistic.  He tried to
formulate to himself what art and science were expressing, so
that he might judge between them.  Art seemed to him
to be taking stock of past achievement, science to be on
the brink of new revelations.
</p>

<p>
He knew so little of science that his thought of it was
little more than a consideration of sleeping sickness.
He reviewed his knowledge of sleeping sickness.  He
thought of it no longer as an abstract intellectual
question, but as man's enemy, an almost human thing, a
pestilence walking in the noonday.  Out in Africa that
horror walked in the noonday, stifling the brains of men.
It fascinated him.  He thought of the little lonely
stations of scientists and soldiers, far away in the wilds, in
the midst of the disease, perhaps feeling it coming on,
as Lionel must have felt it.  They were giving up their
lives cheerily and unconcernedly in the hope of saving
the lives of others.  That was a finer way of living than
sitting in a chair, writing of what Dick said to Tom
when Joe fell in the water.  He went over in his mind
the questions which science had to solve before the
disease could be stamped out.  He wondered if there were
in the literary brain some quickness or clearness which
the scientific brain wanted.  He wondered if he might
solve the questions.  Great discoveries are made by
discoverers, not always by seekers.  What was mysterious
about the sleeping sickness?
</p>

<p>
A little thought reduced his limited knowledge to
order.  The disease is spreading eastwards from the
West Coast of Africa between 16° north and 16° south
latitude, keeping pretty sharply within the thirty-two
degrees, north and south.  It is caused by an organism
called a trypanosome, which enters the blood through
the probosces of biting flies.  It kills, when the
organism enters the cerebro-spinal fluid.  So much was sure.
He could not say with certainty why the disease is
spreading eastwards, nor why the trypanosome causes
it, nor how the fly obtains the trypanosome, nor what
happens to the trypanosome in the fly's body.  His
ignorance thus resolved itself into four heads.
</p>

<p>
As to the spreading of the disease eastwards, Lionel,
who had lived in the country, might know a reason for
it.  He would at least have heard what the natives and
the older settlers thought.  Residents' reasons
generally range from stories of snake-headed women in the
swamp, to tales of a queer case of gin, or of "European
germs changed by the climate."  The simple explanation
was that in mid-Africa human communications are
more frequent from the west to the east than from the
east to the west.  The Congo is the highway.
</p>

<p>
He knew that the trypanosome is carried by the wild
game.  In long generations of suffering the African
big game has won for itself the power of resisting the
trypanosomes.  Although the trypanosomes abound in
their blood, the wild animals do not develop "nagana"
or "surra," the diseases which the tsetse bite sets up in
most domestic animals.  Something has been bred into
their beings which checks the trypanosome's power.
The animals are immune, or salted.  But although they
are immune, the wild animals are hosts to the trypanosome.
In the course of time, when they migrate before
the advance of sportsmen, or in search of pasture into
tsetse country as yet uninfected with trypanosome, the
tsetses attacking them suck the infected blood and
receive the organisms into their bodies.  Later on, as
they bite, they transfer the organisms to human beings,
who develop the disease.  Plainly, a single migratory
animal host, or a single infected slave, suffering from
the initial feverish stages, might travel for three or four
months, infecting a dozen tsetses daily, along his line of
march.  One man or beast might make the route dangerous
for all who followed.  Roger remembered how the
chigoe or jigger-flea had travelled east along the Congo,
to establish itself as an abiding pest wherever there was
sand to shelter it.
</p>

<p>
As to the action of the trypanosome upon the human
being, that was a question for trained scientists.  It
probably amounted to little more than a battle with the
white corpuscles.
</p>

<p>
He passed the next few days at the Museum, studying
the disease.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Holder, who did for Lionel, let him in to
Lionel's rooms on Thursday.  "Mr. Heseltine was
expecting him, and would be in in a minute.  Would he
take a seat?"  He did so.  The rooms were the top
chambers of a house in Pump Court.  They were nice
light airy chambers, sparely furnished.  The floor was
covered with straw-matting.  The chairs were
deck-chairs.  There were a few books on a bookshelf.  Most
of them were bound files of the <i>Lancet</i> and <i>British
Medical Journal</i>.  A few were medical books, picked
up cheap at second-hand shops, as the price labels on
the backs testified.  The rest were mostly military
history: <i>The Jena Campaign</i>; Hoenig's <i>Twenty-four
Hours of Moltke's Strategy</i>; Meckel's <i>Tactics</i> and
Sommernacht's <i>Traum; Chancellorsville</i>; Colonel
Henderson's <i>Life of Stonewall Jackson; Essays on the Science
of War</i> and <i>Spicheren</i>; Wolseley's <i>Life of Marlborough</i>;
Colonel Maude's <i>Leipzig</i>; Stoffel's contribution to the
<i>Vie de Jules Cesar</i>; a battered copy of Mahan's <i>War of
1812</i>; and three or four small military text-books on
<i>Reconnaissance, Minor Tactics, Infantry Formations,</i>
etc.  A book of military memoirs lay open, face downwards,
in a deck-chair.  It was a hot July day, but the
fire was not yet out in the grate.  On the mantelpiece
were some small ebony curios inlaid with mother-of-pearl.
Above the mantel were a few pipes, spears, and
knobkerries, a warrior's Colobus-monkey head-dress
and shield, from Masailand, a chased brass bracket-dish
(probably made in England) containing cigarette-butts,
and a small, but very beautiful Madonna and Child,
evidently by Correggio.  It was dirty, cracked, and
badly hung, but it was still a noble work.  Lionel,
coming in abruptly, found Roger staring at it.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you've not been waiting," he said.  "I've
been to see my monkey.  Are you fond of pictures?
That's said to be a rather good one.  It's by a man
called Correggio.  Do you know his work at all?  It's
rather dingy.  Do you like lemon or milk in your tea?
Lemon?  You like lemon, do you?  Right.  And will
you wait a minute while I give myself a last dose?"
</p>

<p>
"Can I help you?" Roger asked.  "It's hypodermic,
isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Would you mind?  You shove the snout of the
thing into my arm, and push the spirit.  It won't take a
minute."  He shewed Roger into a Spartan bedroom,
furnished with a camp-bed and a Sandow's exerciser.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he said, producing a bottle and a syringe,
"first I'll roll up my sleeve, and then I'll shew you how
to sterilise the needle.  I suppose you've never done
this kind of thing before?  Now, jab it in just here
where all the punctures are."
</p>

<p>
"You said it was your last dose," said Roger.
"Does that mean that you are cured?"
</p>

<p>
"Cured for the time.  I may get a relapse.  Still,
that isn't likely."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that you are cured?  Do you
feel better?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't get insomnia," said Lionel.  "No.  They
inject bits of me into a monkey, and then wait to see if
the monkey develops the organism.  The monkey's very
fit indeed, so they reckon that I'm cured.  Thanks.
That'll do.  Now I hear tea coming.  Go on in, will
you?  I'll be out in a minute.  I must get out my
slides."
</p>

<p>
After, tea they looked at relics, to wit, tsetse-flies,
butterflies, biting flies, fragments of the same, sections
of them, slides of trypanosomes, slides of filaria, slides
of Laverania.  "I've got these photographs, too," said
Lionel.  "They aren't very good; but they give you
an idea of the place.  This lot are all rather dark.  I
suppose they were over-exposed.  They shew you the
sort of places the tsetse likes.  The hut in this one is a
native hut.  I lived in it while I was out there the last
time.  I was studying the tsetse's ways."
</p>

<p>
"They're always near water, aren't they?" Roger asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, generally near water.  They keep to a narrow
strip of cover by the side of a lake or stream.  They
don't like to go very far from water unless they are
pursuing a victim.  In fact, you're perfectly safe if you
avoid fly-country.  If you go into fly-country, of course
they come for you.  They'll hunt you for some way
when you leave it.  They like a shady water with a
little sandy shady beach at the side.  They like sand or
loose soil better than mud.  Mud breeds sedge, which
they don't care about.  They like a sort of scrubby
jungle.  One or two trees attract them especially.
Here's a tree where about a dozen natives got it together
merely from taking their siesta there."
</p>

<p>
"Does clearing the jungle do any good?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  It clears the flies out of that particular
spot.  But it scatters them abroad.  It doesn't destroy
them.  It doesn't destroy the pupæ, which are buried
under the roots in the ground.  Burning is better,
perhaps.  Burning may do for the pupæ, but then it doesn't
affect the grown flies."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," said Roger, "is blood necessary to the
tsetse?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish I knew."
</p>

<p>
"I've been thinking about the spread of the disease.
Is it caused by game, by slave-raiders, or by
ivory-hunters?  How is it spread?"
</p>

<p>
"We don't know.  It seems to have followed the
opening up of the Congo basin to trade.  The game are
reservoirs, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Have the natives any cure?"
</p>

<p>
"None.  They have a disinfectant for their cattle.
They boil up some bitter bark with one dead tsetse and
make the cattle drink the brew.  Then they fumigate
the cattle with bitter smoke.  They go through this
business when they are about to trek cattle through
fly-country.  They travel at night, because the flies don't
bite after dark.  But the fumigation business is really
useless."
</p>

<p>
"The tsetse is useless, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"All flies are useless."
</p>

<p>
"I like the ladybird and the chalk-blue butterfly."
</p>

<p>
"I see you're a sentimentalist.  You might keep
those.  But all the rest I would wipe out utterly.  I
wish that we could wipe out the tsetse as easily as one
can wipe out the germ-carrying mosquitoes."
</p>

<p>
"Has it been tried?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Well.  It may have been.  But in the mosquito
there is a well-marked grub stage, and in the tsetse
there isn't.  It is so difficult to get at the chrysalids
satisfactorily."
</p>

<p>
"What do the tsetses live upon?  Do you mind all
my questions?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Go ahead.  But it must be rather boring to
you.  They live on anything they can get, like the
commissioners who study them."
</p>

<p>
"But why do they live near water?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that?  Some think that they suck the crocodiles;
but the general opinion is that they go for
air-breathing, fresh-water fish.  The theory is this.  In the
dry season the fish have very little water.  The rivers
dry up, or very nearly dry up.  I'm not talking of
rivers like the Zambesi and the Congo, of course.  Well.
They dry up, leaving water-courses of shallow pools
joined together by trickles.  The fish are perfectly
horrible creatures.  They burrow into the mud of the
shallows, and stay there till the rains.  I suppose they
keep their snouts out of the mud, in order to breathe.
It is thought that the tsetses feed upon their snouts.
It may not be true.  Jolly interesting if it is, don't you
think?  Look here, excuse me if I smoke.  Tell me.
What is it which interests you so much in sleeping
sickness?  It seems so queer that you should be interested."
</p>

<p>
"I met with accounts of it not long ago, at a time
when various causes had made me very sensitive to
impressions.  I don't know whether you ever feel that
what is happening to you is part of a great game
divinely ordained?"
</p>

<p>
Lionel shook his head.  His look became a shade
more medical.
</p>

<p>
"Well.  It sounds foolish," said Roger.  "But I
was impressed by the way in which sleeping sickness
was brought to my notice again and again.  So I
studied it, as well as one so ignorant of science could.
I am interested now, because you've been there and seen
it all.  It is always very interesting to hear another
man's life-experience.  But it is more than that.  The
disease must be one of the most frightful things of
modern times.  I think it splendid of you to have gone
out, as you have, to study it for the good of mankind."
</p>

<p>
"That was only self-indulgence," said Lionel.  "It's
queer that you should be interested.  You're the only
person I've met yet since I came back who is really
interested.  Of course, the doctors have been interested.
But I believe that most Londoners have lost the faculty
for serious mental interest.  It has been etiolated out
of them.  They like your kind of thing, 'sugar and
spice and all things nice.'  They like catchwords.
They don't study hard nor get at the roots of things.
I met a Spaniard the other day, Centeno, a chemist, I
don't mean a druggist.  He said that we had begun to
wither at the top."
</p>

<p>
"I don't agree," said Roger.  "Spain is too withered
to judge.  Our head is as sound oak as it always was.
Were you ever a soldier, Heseltine?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, in a sort of a way.  I was in the militia."
</p>

<p>
"Did you want to be a soldier?  Why did you leave it?"
</p>

<p>
"It isn't a life, unless you're on a General Staff.
Everybody ought to be able to be a soldier; I believe
that; but it doesn't seem to me to go very far as a
life's pursuit.  One can only become a good soldier by
passing all one's days in fighting.  That doesn't lead to
anything.  I would like best of all to be a writer, only,
of course, I can't be.  I haven't got the brains.  I
suppose you'll say they're not essential."
</p>

<p>
"They are essential, and you've probably got as many
as any writer; but writing is an art, and success in art
depends on all sorts of subtle, instantaneous relations
between the brain's various faculties and the hand.
Are you really serious, though?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I'd give the world to be able to write.  To
write poetry.  Or I'd like to be able to write a play.
You see, what I believe is, that this generation is full of
all sorts of energy which ought not to be applied to
dying things.  I would like to write a poem on the right
application of energy.  That is the important thing
nowadays.  The English have lots of energy, and so
much of it is wasted.  The energy wasted is just so
much setting back the clock.  The energy wasted at
schools alone&mdash;&mdash;  If I'd not been a juggins at school,
I'd have been fully qualified by this time, and been
able to get a lot more fun out of things, finding out what
goes on.  Don't you find writing awfully interesting?"
</p>

<p>
"I find it makes the world more interesting.  Writing
lets one into life.  But when I meet a man like
yourself I realise that it isn't a perfect life for a man.
It isn't active enough.  It doesn't seem to me to
exercise enough of the essential nature.  Have you ever
tried to write?  I expect you have written a lot of
splendid things.  Will you shew me what you have
written?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Lionel, "I've only written a few sonnets
and things.  Out there alone at night when the lions
are roaring, you can't help it.  They used to roar all
round me.  I was only in a native hut.  It gives one a
solemn feeling.  I used to make up verses every
night."
</p>

<p>
"Have you got any?  Won't you read them to me?"
</p>

<p>
"You can look at them if you like," said Lionel,
blushing under his tan.  Like most Englishmen, he was
a little ashamed of having any intelligence at all.  He
pulled out a little penny account-book from the drawer
under the bookshelf.  "They're pretty bad, I expect."
</p>

<p>
Roger looked at them.
</p>

<p>
"They're not bad at all," he said.  "You've got
something to say.  You haven't got much ear; but
that's only a matter of training.  People can always
write well if they are moved or interested.  Great
writing happens when a carefully trained technician undergoes
a deep emotion, or, still better, has survived one.
Have you written prose at all?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Prose is much more difficult.  I never know
when to stop."
</p>

<p>
"Nor do I.  Prose becomes hard directly one begins
to make it an art instead of a second nature."
</p>

<p>
He wanted to talk with Lionel about Portobe.  He
was in that mood in which the wound of a grief aches
to be stricken.  He wanted to know what Lionel had
said to Ottalie, and what she had said to him.  He had
that feeling which sometimes comes to one in London.
"Here you are, in London, before me.  And you have
been in such a place and such a place, where I myself
have been, and you have talked with people known to
me.  How wonderful life is!"  To his delight, Lionel
began to talk about Ireland unprompted.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could write prose like yours," he said.
"It was your prose first made me want to write.  I was
stopping with the Fawcetts at Portobe.  It was the
year before Leslie married, just before I went to India,
to do Delhi-sore.  Ottalie had just got that book you
wrote about the Dall.  You'd sent it to her.  That was
a fine book.  I liked your little word-pictures."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry you liked that book.  It is very crude.
I remember Ottalie was down on me for it."
</p>

<p>
"Ottalie was a fine person," said Lionel.  "She had
such a delicate, quick mind.  And then.  I don't know.
One can't describe a woman.  A man does things and
defines himself by doing them, but a woman just is.
Ottalie just was; but I don't know what she was.  I
think she was about the finest thing I've ever seen."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Roger, moistening dry lips.  "She was
like light."
</p>

<p>
"What I noticed most about her," said Lionel, taking
on now the tone of a colonial who has lived much
away from the society of women, "was her fineness.
She did things in a way no other woman could.  When
I came back from the East, and went to see her&mdash;of
course I used to go to Portobe fairly often when Leslie
was there&mdash;it was like being with some one from
another world.  She was so full of fun, too.  She had a
way of doing things simply.  I'm not good at describing;
but you know how some writers write a thing easily
because they know it to the heart.  Ottalie Fawcett
seemed to do things simply, because she understood
them to the heart, by intuition."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Roger.  "I shall always be proud to
have lived among a race which could bear such a person."
</p>

<p>
"She must be a dreadful loss," said Lionel, "to
anybody who knew her well.  I'm afraid you knew her
well.  I used to think of her when I was in Africa.
She was wonderful."
</p>

<p>
"She was a wonderful spirit," Roger answered.
"Tell me.  I seem to know you very well, although I
have hardly met you.  I don't even know if your
people are alive.  Is your mother living?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Lionel.  "You're thinking of my old
aunt who was at the At Home with me.  I was stopping
with her for a few days, before she left town.
My people are dead."
</p>

<p>
"Are you thinking of going out again to Africa to
examine sleeping sickness?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Lionel.  "I want to go soon.  I want
to go in the rains, so that I can test a native statement,
that the rains aggravate the disease and tend to bring
it out where it is latent.  I believe it is all nonsense.
Natives observe, but never deduce.  Still, one ought to
know."
</p>

<p>
"Would you go alone?"
</p>

<p>
"I should go out alone, I suppose.  There are lots
of men who would come with me to shoot lions, but
trypanosomes are less popular.  You don't bring back
many trophies from trypanosomes, except a hanging
jaw and injected eyes."
</p>

<p>
"Are the rains very unhealthy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  If they bring out the latent disease, they do
so by lowering the constitution.  But I don't believe
that they do anything of the kind.  Still, the natives
say that they can bring out nagana in a bitten cow by
pouring a bucket of water over her."
</p>

<p>
"Look here," said Roger, "I don't want you to decide
definitely till you know me better.  I know how
risky a thing it is to choose a companion for a journey
into the wilderness, or for any undertaking of this kind.
But I am dissatisfied with my work.  I can't tell you
more.  I don't think that my work is using enough of
me, or letting me grow up evenly.  Besides, for other
reasons, I want to give up writing.  I am deeply
interested in your work, and I should like to join you, if
you would let me, after you know me better.  I have a
theory which I should like to work out."
</p>

<p>
"It would be very nice," said Lionel.  "I mean it
would be very nice for me.  But it means pretty severe
work, remember.  And then, how about scientific training?
I'm not properly qualified myself; but I've been
at this game for seven years, and I had a hard year's
training under my old chief, Sir Patrick Hamlin.  I
began by doing First Aid and Bearer-Party in camp.
Then, when I gave up soldiering, I got a job on famine
relief in India.  Then old Hamlin took me under his
wing, and got me to help with the plague at Bombay,
and so I went on, learning whatever I could.  I was
very lucky.  I mean, I was able to learn a good deal,
being always with Hamlin.  You ought to know
Hamlin.  He's a very remarkable man.  He stamped out
Travancore ophthalmia.  He made me very keen and
taught me all that I know.  Not that that's much.
Now you are rather a griff, if you'll excuse my saying
so.  I wonder how soon you could make yourself useful?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is wanted?" said Roger.  "Surely not
much?  What can you do with the disease?  You can
only inject atoxyl into a man, and pump trypanosomes
out of him?  I can learn how to mount and stain
objects for the microscope.  I have kept meteorological
records.  I could surely keep records of temperatures.
I have no experience and no scientific knowledge; but
I am not sure that my particular theory will need much
more than prolonged, steady observation.  Probably all
the attainable scientific facts about the structures of the
different varieties of tsetse are known, but the habits
of the flies are very little known.  I was thinking that
a minute observation of the flies would be useful.  It is
a kind of work which a trained scientist might find dull.
Now, who has really observed the tsetse's habits?  It
is not even known what their food is.  And another
thing.  What is it which keeps them near the water,
even when (for all that we know) the air-breathing fish
are no longer burrowed in the mud?  And why should
they be so fond of certain kinds of jungle?  And why
should there not be some means of exterminating them?
I could experiment in many ways."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  That is true.  You could," said Lionel,
puckering his face.  "How do you stand heat?
You're slight.  You can probably stand more than a
big beefy fellow."
</p>

<p>
"I did not find Belize very trying."
</p>

<p>
"Then it's an expensive business," said Lionel.
"When I go out I shan't be attached to any commission.
One has to go into all these sordid details pretty closely.
Of course, you won't mind my giving you one or two
tips.  Here's my account book for a quite short trip
to Ikupu.  You will see that it is very costly and very
wasteful."
</p>

<p>
Roger looked at the account-book.  The cost of the
Ikupu trip was certainly heavy.  The relatives of two
bearers who had been eaten by lions had received
compensation.  The widow of the dead assistant had
received compensation.  A month's stores had been
thrown away by deserting bearers.  The dirty, dog's-eared
pages gave him a sense of the wasteful, deathy,
confused life which goes on in new countries before
wasteful, cruel, confused nature has the ideas of her
"rebellious son" imposed upon her.  "We went out
seventy strong," said Lionel, "to go to Ikupu.  We had
bad luck from the very start.  Only twelve of us ever
got there.  You see, my assistant, Marteilhe, was
frightfully ill.  I had fever on and off the whole time.
So the bearers did what they liked.  It's a heart-breaking
country to travel in.  It's like Texas.  'A good
land for men and dogs, but hell for women and oxen.'  What
do you think?  Does it seem to you to be worth
the waste?"
</p>

<p>
"Very well worth," said Roger, handing back the
book.  "If I fail to do one little speck of good there,
it will have been very well worth, both for my own
character and for my own time."
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite see your point," said Lionel.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Roger, moved.  "I want to be quite
sure of certain elements in myself, before I settle down
to a literary life.  That life, if it be in the least worthy,
is consecrated to the creation of the age's moral
consciousness.  In the old time a writer was proved by the
world before he could begin to create his "ideas of good
and evil."  Homer never existed, of course, but the old
idea of a poet's being blind is very significant.  Poets
must have been men of action, like the other men of
their race.  They only became poets when they lost
their sight, or ceased, through some wound or sickness,
to be efficient in the musters, when, in fact, their lives
were turned inwards.  Nowadays that is changed,
Heseltine.  A man writes because he has read, or
because he is idle, or greedy, or vicious, or vain, for a
dozen different reasons; but very seldom because his
whole life has been turned inward by the discipline of
action, thought, or suffering.  I am not sure of
myself.  Miss Fawcett's death has brought a lot into my
life which I never suspected.  I begin to think that a
writer without character, without high and austere
character, in himself, and in the written image of
himself, is a panderer, a bawd, a seller of Christ."  He
rose from his chair.  He paced the room once or twice.
"Jacob Boehme was right," he went on.  "We are
watery people.  Without action we are stagnant.  If
you sit down to write, day after day, for months on
end, you can feel the scum growing on your mind."  He
sat down again, staring at the Correggio.
"There," he said, "that is all it is.  I sometimes feel
that all the thoroughly good artists, like Dürer,
Shakespeare, Michael Angelo, Dante, all of them, sit in
judgment on the lesser artists when they die.  I think they
forgive bad art, because they know how jolly difficult
art of any kind is.  I don't believe that art was ever
easy to anybody, except perhaps to women, whose whole
lives are art.  But they would never forgive faults of
character or of life.  They would exact a high strain
of conduct, mercilessly.  Good God, Heseltine, it seems
to me terrible that a man should be permitted to write
a play before he has risked his life for another, or for
the State."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Lionel, picking up his cigarette, which
had fallen to the floor, scattering sparks.  "Yes."  He
pressed his forefinger reflectively on each crumb of fire
one after the other.  "Yes.  But look here.  I met
that French poet fellow, Mongeron, the other day, the
day before yesterday.  He said that action was
unnecessary to the man of thought, since the imagination
enabled him to possess all experience imaginatively."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I know that pleasant theory.  I agree," said
Roger.  "But only when action has formed the character.
I take writing very seriously, but I want to be
sure that it is the thing which will bring out the best in
me.  I am doubtful of that.  I am doubtful even
whether art of any kind is not an anachronism in this
scientific century, when so much is being learned and
applied to the bettering of life.  As I said the other
night, my State is the human mind.  If this art, about
which I have spilled such a lot of ink, be really a
survival, what you call in dissecting-rooms 'a fossil,' then
I am not helping my State, but hindering her, by
giving all my brains' vitality to an obsolete cause.  One
feels very clever, with these wise books in one's head;
but they don't go down to bed-rock.  They don't mean
much in the great things of life.  They don't help one
over a death."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Lionel reflectively.  "I think I see all
your points."  He made the subject practical at once,
feeling a little beyond his depth in ethics.  "It would
be a very interesting experience for you to go out," he
said.  "A fine thing, too; for it is very difficult to get
a good brain to take up a subject in that particular way.
Still, one ought not to waste a good brain like yours in
watching tsetses."
</p>

<p>
"No imaginative work is wasted," said Roger.
"The experience would add a great deal to me.  I
should feel more sure of being able to face the judge
after death."
</p>

<p>
"How about the practice of your art?"
</p>

<p>
"That will not be hurt by the deepening of my interests."
</p>

<p>
"Come on out to dinner," said Lionel.  "I generally
go to Simpson's.  We'll go into Committee of Supply.
The first thing we shall have to do is to try to get you
the job of bottle-washer to somebody's clinic.  What I
want to do when I get out there is this, Naldrett.  I
want to get right away into the back of beyond, into the
C.F.S., or wherever there is not much chance of the
natives having mixed with Europeans.  I want to find
out if there is any native cure, if any native tribes are
immune, as they are to malaria, and whether their
cattle, if they have any, are immune, like the game.  You
will guess that what I want to do is to prepare anti-toxins
strong enough to resist the disease at any stage,
and also to act as preventives.  That's the problem as
it seems to me.  It may sound a little crazy."
</p>

<p>
"Is the tsetse immune?" said Roger.  "Does anybody
know anything about flies?  If the tsetse is immune,
why could not an anti-toxin be prepared from the
tsetse?  It would be more than science.  It would be
equity."
</p>

<p>
They walked along the Strand together.
</p>

<p>
"Anti-toxins must wait," said Roger, as they stopped
before crossing Wellington Street.  "The first thing we
had better do is to go for a long tramp together, to see
how we get along."
</p>

<p>
"We might charter a boat, and try to get round the
north of Ireland," said Lionel.  "Dublin to Moville.
It would be a thorough eye-opener.  Then we might
walk on round the coast to Killybegs.  Old Hamlin will
be back by the end of August.  He would prescribe
you a course of study.  We might do some reading together."
</p>

<p>
In the Strand, outside Simpson's, a procession of
dirty boys followed a dirty drunkard who was being
taken to Bow Street by two policemen.  Newsboys,
with debased, predatory faces, peered with ophthalmic
eyes into betting news.  Other symptoms of disease
passed.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty of disease here," said Roger.
</p>

<p>
"All preventable," said Lionel.  "Only we're not
allowed to prevent it.  People here would rather have
it by them to reform.  Science won't mix with
sentiment, thank God!"  They entered Simpson's.

<p>
Ten months later Roger sat swathed in blankets
under mosquito netting, steering a boat
upstream.  He was in the cold fit of a fever.
The bows of the boat were heaped with the cages of
laboratory animals and with boxes, on the top of which
a negro sat, singing a song.  The singer clapped
gravely with his hands to mark the time.  "Marumba
is very far away," he sang.  "Yes.  It is far away,
and nobody ever got there."  At times, pausing in his
song to lift a hand to Roger, he pointed out a snag or
shoal.  At other times the rowers, lifting their paddles
wearily, sang for a few bars in chorus, about the bones
on the road to Marumba.  Then the chorus died; the
paddles splashed; the tholes grunted.  The boat lagged
on into the unknown, up the red, savage river, which
loitered, and steamed, and stank, like a river of a
beginning earth.
</p>

<p>
Lionel, heaped with blankets, lay at Roger's feet.
His teeth were chattering.  The wet rag round his
forehead had slipped over his eyes.  The debile motion
of the hand which tried to thrust the rag away, so that
he might see, told of an intense petulant weakness.
By him lay a negro, wasted to a skeleton, who watched
Roger with a childish grave intentness out of eyes
heavy with death.
</p>

<p>
The boat ground slowly past a snag.  Roger, raising
himself upon a box, looked out painfully over the river
bank to the immense distance beyond, where, in a
dimness, mists hung.  To the right, a mile or two from the
river, was forest, sloping to an expanse of water,
intensely blue.  Beyond the water was grass sloping up
to forest.  The forest jutted out, immense, dark, silent.
Nothing lay beyond it but forest, trees towering up,
trees fallen, uprooted, rotting, a darkness, a green
gloom.  Over it was the sky, of hard, bright blue metal,
covered with blazing films.  Outside it, like captains
halted at the head of a horde, were solitary, immense
trees, with ruddy boles.  To each side of them, the
forest stretched, an irregular wilderness of wood, grey,
rather than green, in the glare aloft; below, darker.
The water at the foot of the slope opened out in bays,
ruffled by the wind, shimmering.  Reeds grew about the
bays.  A cluster of tall, orange-blossomed water-plants
hid the rest from Roger's sight as the boat loitered on.
</p>

<p>
To the left it was a sometimes swampy plain-land,
reaching on into the mists, with ants' nests for milestones.
Little gentle hills rose up, some of them dotted
with thorn-trees.  They were like the stumps of islands
worn away by the river, when, long ago, it had brimmed
that plain-land from the forest to the far horizon.
</p>

<p>
Far ahead, to the left of the river, Roger noticed a
slightly larger hill.  It held his gaze for a few minutes.
It stood up from the plain exactly like a Roman camp
which he had visited in England long before, one
Christmas Day.  He liked to look at it.  There was comfort
in looking at it.  It was like a word from Europe, that
hill beyond there, greyish in the blinding light.  It was
like a Roman camp, like military virtue, order, calm,
courage, dignity.  He needed some such message.  He
was in command of a shipload of suffering.  He was
wandering on into the unknown, in charge of dying
men.  Smoke was rising from below the hill, a single
spire of smoke.  He hailed the singer.
</p>

<p>
"Merrylegs," he cried, "what is the smoke there?"
</p>

<p>
"Jualapa," said the man, standing up to look.
"Jualapa."
</p>

<p>
"It can't be Jualapa," said Lionel petulantly, struggling
to lift his blankets.  "Oh, stop that noise, Roger.
It shakes my head to pieces."
</p>

<p>
"Jualapa," cried the rowers excitedly.  "Jualapa."  They
dropped their paddles.  Standing on the thwarts
they peered under the sharps of their hands at the
rising smoke.  They rubbed their bellies, thinking of
meat.  One of them, beating his hands together, broke
into a song about Jualapa.
</p>

<p>
Roger, stumbling forward, shaken by sickness, bade
them to give way, quietly.  The jabbering died down
as the tholes began again to grunt.  Merrylegs, still
clapping his hands, broke into another song.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Jualapa is near.  Yes, Jualapa is near.  Not like Marumba.<br />
  We will eat meat in Jualapa.  Much meat.  Much meat.<br />
  The men of Little Belly will eat meat in Jualapa.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Shut your silly head, Merrylegs," cried Roger
angrily.  The song broke off.  Merrylegs began to tell
the bow-oar what meat there would be in Jualapa.  He
said that there would be cattle, and perhaps a diseased
cow among them.  The rowing seemed to freshen a
little.  The boat dragged on a little quicker.
</p>

<p>
"How are you, Lionel?" Roger asked.  It was a
foolish question.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, for God's sake don't ask silly questions," said
Lionel very weakly.  "Do leave me alone."
</p>

<p>
For answer, Roger gently renewed the compress
round the sick man's head.  From the thirst which was
torturing him he guessed that his fever's hot fit would
soon begin.  He prayed that it might keep off until
they had reached the smoke.  They were probably
nearing some village.  They might camp at the village.
Only he would have to be well when they reached the
village.  He would have to get Lionel ashore, into
some comfortable hut.  He would have to feed him
there with some strong comforting broth.  Before he
could do that, he would have to see the village headman.
He would have to look after the bearers.  The boat
would have to be moored.  Some of her gear would
have to be unloaded.
</p>

<p>
There could be no thought of going on, upstream,
to Jualapa, in their present state.  A native had told
them, the day before, that Jualapa, three days' journey
upstream, was stricken with sleeping sickness.  "All
were sleeping," he said.  "Men, women, and little
children.  The cattle were not milked at Jualapa."  It was
the first time that they had heard of the disease since
leaving the coast.  They had decided to attempt
Jualapa.
</p>

<p>
They were both suffering from fever.  They would
have been glad to camp for a few days before pushing
on; but Lionel forbade it.  The rowers were getting
homesick.  Three of them had contracted dysentery.
He felt that if they called a halt anywhere their men
would desert them.  The important thing was to push
on, he said, to carry the men so far that they would
be afraid to run.  If the men deserted after the leaders
had engaged the disease, well and good, there would
be the work to do.  But if they deserted before that,
the expedition would end before Roger took his first
lumbar puncture.  It was the last sensible decision
Lionel had been able to make.  His fever had recurred
within the hour.  Since then he had been dangerously
ill, so ill, and with such violent changes of temperature,
that his weakness, now that the fever lifted, frightened
Roger.
</p>

<p>
Roger shook and chattered, trying to think.  He was
ill; so ill that he could not think clearly.  The horrible
part of it, to him, was to be just clear enough in his
head to fear to change Lionel's decision.  He wanted to
change for Lionel's sake; but with this fever smouldering
in his brain, surging and lifting, like a hot blast
withering him, the plan seemed august, like a law of
the Medes and Persians.  He was afraid of changing.
At last, in a momentary clearing of the head, he made
up his mind to change.  He would anchor.  They
would halt at the smoke.  They would land and camp.
Nothing could be done till the leaders were cured.  If
the men deserted, he would trust to luck to be able to
hire new men.  He could not go on like this; Lionel
might die.  The fever closed in upon his mind again,
surging and withering.  The air seemed strangely
thick.  Merrylegs wavered and blurred.  The boat
grounded on a mud-bank, and brushed past some
many-shimmering reeds with a long swish.  The dying negro,
stirred by some memory, which the noise had awakened
in him, raised himself faintly, asking something.  He
fell back faint, closing his eyes, then opening them.
He beat with one hand, jabbering the name Mpaka.
His teeth clenched.  He was in the death agony.  One
of the stroke-oars, clambering over the boxes in the
stern-sheets, beat the dying man upon the chest.  He
was beating out the devil, he explained.  He soon grew
tired.  He shouted in the sick man's ear, laughed
delightedly at his groans, and went forward to explain
his prowess.  He broke out into a song about it.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Kilemba has a big devil in his belly.<br />
  Big devil eat up Kilemba.  Eat all up.<br />
  But Muafi a strong man.  Very strong man.  Devil no good.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not eat Muafi.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
They swept round a bend, where crocodiles, like great
worm-casts, sunned and nuzzled, with mud caking off
their bellies.  The boat passed into a broad, above
which, the hill like a Roman camp rose up.  Pink
cranes stood in the shallows.  Slowly, one of them rose
aloft, heavily flagging.  Another rose, then another,
then another, till they made a pinkish ribbon against
the forest.  Following the line of their flight Roger
saw a few delicate deer leave their pasture, startled by
the starting of the cranes.  They moved off daintily,
looking uneasily behind them.  Soon they broke into
a run.
</p>

<p>
On the left bank, in a space of poor soil, covered with
shingle by a freshet, some vultures cowered and sidled
about a dead thing.  Roger stared stupidly at them.
Something of a warning of death moved through the
surging of his fever.  He said to himself that there was
death here.  Words spoke in his brain, each word like
a fire-flash.  "No white man has ever been here before.
You are the first.  Take care.  There is death here."  Some
vague fear of possible war, so vague that he was
not quite certain that it was not a memory of a
war-scare at home, made him look to his revolver.  He
thrust up the catch with his thumb, and stared at the
seven dull brass discs pulled slightly forward by the
extractor.  There were seven, and we are seven, and
there were seven planets.  The fever made him stare at
the opened breech for a full minute.
</p>

<p>
Out of some tall water-plants, whose long, bluish-grey
leaves looked very cool in the glare of heat, came
flies.  They came to the attack with a whirling fierceness
like clegs.  They were small, brown, insignificant
flies.  They were tsetse flies.  The boat pulled out into
the open to avoid them.  After a few more minutes
Roger called upon the rowers to stop rowing.
</p>

<p>
He was in the middle of the broad, looking at the left
bank, where a trodden path led to the water's edge.
For many centuries men and beasts had watered there.
The path had worn a deep rut into the bank.  What
struck Roger about it was its narrowness.  It was the
narrow track of savages.  The people who made it had
used it fearfully, one at a time, full of suspicion, like
drinking deer.  Their fear had had a kind of idealism
about it.  It might truly be said of those nervous
drinkers that when they drank, they drank to the good
health of their State.  Even in his fever, the sight of
the path shocked Roger with a sense of the danger of
life in this place.  What was the danger?  What was
the life?
</p>

<p>
Beyond the track, at a little distance from the river,
was a thick thorn hedge surrounding a village.  From
the midst of the village a single stream of smoke arose.
It went up straight for a foot or two, behind the shelter
of the hedge.  Then it blew down gustily, in wavering
puffs.  There was no other sign of life in the village.
A few hens were picking food in the open.  A cow,
standing with drooped head above the corpse of her
calf, awaited death.  Her bones were coming through
her skin, poor beast.  There were black patches of flies
upon her.  Three vultures waited for her.  One of
them was stretching his wings with the air of a man
yawning.  Vultures were busy about a dead cow in the
middle distance.  Dark heaps, further off, had still
something of the appearance of cows.  The men, looking
earnestly about from the tops of the boxes, jabbered
excitedly, pointing.  Roger unslung his binoculars and
stared at the silent place.  He could see no one.  There
were dead cows, a dying cow, and those few clucking
hens.  He wondered if there could be an ambush.
The grass was tall enough, in the clumps, to shelter an
enemy; but the wild birds passed from clump to clump
without fear.  In a bare patch two scarlet-headed birds
were even fighting together.  Their neck feathers were
ruffled erect.  They struck and tugged.  They rose,
flapping, to cuff each other with their wings.  Leaping
aloft they thrust with their spurs.  A hen, less
brilliantly coloured, watched the battle.  But for these
birds the place was peaceful.  The wind ruffled the
grass; the smoke was gusty; one of the poultry crooned
with a long gurgling cluck.
</p>

<p>
Something made Roger look from the village to the
hill like a Roman camp.  It glistened grey in the
sun-blaze.  The dance of the air above it was queer, almost
like smoke.  He stared at it through his glasses.  After
a long look he turned to stare into the water to rest his
eyes.  "I am mad," he said to himself.  "I am
dreaming this.  Presently I shall wake up."  He looked
again.  There could be no doubt of it.  The hill was
covered with a grey stone wall at least thirty feet high.
There, about three-quarters of a mile away, was the ruin
of an ancient town, as old, perhaps, as the Pharaohs.
There was no doubt that it was old.  Parts of it,
undermined by burrowing things, or thrust out by growing
things, were fallen in heaps.  Other parts were
overgrown twelve feet thick, with vegetation.  Trees grew
out of it.  A few cacti upon the wall-top were sharply
outlined against the sky.  On the further end of the
wall there was a fire-coloured blaze, where some poisonous
weed, having stifled down all weaker life, triumphed
in sprawling yellow blossoms, spotted and smeared with
drowsy juice.  There were dense swarms of flies above
it as Roger could guess from the movements of the birds
across the path.  He watched the ruin.  There was no
trace of human occupation there.  No smoke shewed
there.  Apparently the place had become a possession
for the bittern.  Wild beasts of the forests lay there,
owls dwelt there, and satyrs danced there.  It was as
desolate as Babylon at the end of Isaiah xiii.
</p>

<p>
He looked at the men to see what effect the ruin had
upon them.  They did not look at it.  They had the
limited primitive intelligence, which cannot see beyond
the facts of physical life.  They were looking at the
village, jabbering as they looked.
</p>

<p>
"What are we stopping for?" said Lionel.
</p>

<p>
"There's a village," said Roger.  "It seems to have
cattle plague."  Lionel struggled weakly to a sitting
position, and looked out with vacant eyes.
</p>

<p>
"There's a ruin on the hill, there," said Roger.
</p>

<p>
"Plague and ruin are the products of this land," said
Lionel.  "Don't stand there doddering, Naldrett.
Find out what's happening here."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, you rest," said Roger with an effort.
"Just lie back on the blankets here, and rest."
</p>

<p>
"How the devil am I to rest when you won't keep
the gang quiet?"
</p>

<p>
"You just close your eyes, Lionel," said Roger.
"Close them.  Keep them closed."  He sluiced a rag
in the shallow water.  "Here's a new compress for
you."
</p>

<p>
He ordered the men to pull in to the watering-place,
while he looked about in what he called the toy box
for presents for the village chief.  He took some copper
wire, a few brass cartridge shells, some green beads,
some bars of brightly coloured sealing wax, a doll or
two, of the kind which say, "Mamma," when stricken
on the solar plexus, a doll's mirror, a knife, an empty
green bottle, and a tin trumpet.  He tilted a white-lined
green umbrella over Lionel's head.  He slipped
over the side as the boat grounded.  Merrylegs followed
him, carrying the presents.  They slopped through
shallow water, and climbed the bank.
</p>

<p>
Merrylegs, clapping his hands loudly, called to the
villagers in the Mwiri dialect that a king, a white man,
a most glorious person, was advancing to them.  Roger
asked him if he had heard of this village at their
stopping-place the day before.  No, he said, he had never
heard of this village.  It was a poor place, very far
away; he had never heard of it.  He called again,
batting with his hands.  No answer came.  Roger,
looking anxiously about, saw no sign of life.  No sign
shewed on the city wall.  A new vulture, lighting by
the dying cow, eyed him gravely, without enthusiasm.
One of those already there flapped his wings again as
though yawning.  "Merrylegs," said Roger, "we must
go into the village."  He shifted round his revolver
holster, so that the weapon lay to hand.  They skirted
the zareba till they came to the low hole, two feet
square, which led through the thorns into the town.
The mud of the road was pounded hard by the continual
passing of the natives.  Fragments of a crudely
decorated pottery were trodden in here and there.  Lying
down flat, Merrylegs could see that the stakes which
served as door to the entrance, were not in place inside
the stockade.  The visitor was free to enter.  "Think
all gone away," said Merrylegs.  "Slave man he
catch."
</p>

<p>
Roger did not now believe in the theory of slave man.
</p>

<p>
"It is nonsense," he said.  "Nonsense.  There
must be death here."  He stood by the gate, breathing
heavily, not quite knowing, from time to time, what he
was doing, at other times knowing clearly, but not
caring.  Little things, the crawling of a tick, the cluck of
a hen, the noise of his own breath, seemed important to
his fever-clogged brain.  "I'll go in," he said, at last.
</p>

<p>
"Not go in," said Merrylegs promptly.  "Perhaps
inside.  Perhaps make him much beer.  All drunk
him."  He called again in Mwiri, but no answer came.
A hen, perhaps expecting food, came clucking through
the hole, cocking her eyes at the strangers.  Roger,
finding a bit of biscuit in his pocket, dropped it
before her.  She worried it away from his presence, and
gulped it down gluttonously before the other hens
could see.
</p>

<p>
Roger knelt down.  Peering up the tunnel he tried
to make out what lay within.  He could not see.  The
entrance passage had been built with a bend in the
middle for the greater safety of the tribe.  For all that
he could know, a warrior might lie beyond the bend,
ready to thrust a spear into him.  He did not think of
this till a long time afterwards.  He began to shuffle
along the passage on all fours.  Nothing lay beyond the
bend.  He clambered to his feet inside the village.
"Come on in, Merrylegs," he called.  Merrylegs came.
They looked about them.
</p>

<p>
The village formed an irregular circle about two
hundred yards across.  Inside the thorn hedge it was
strongly palisaded with wooden spikes, nine feet high,
bound together with wattle, and plastered with a
mud-dab.  The huts stood well away from the palisade.
They formed a rough avenue, shaped rather like a
sickle.  There were thirty-five huts still standing.
The frames of two or three others stood, waiting
completion.  One or two more had fallen into disrepair.
Several inhabitants were in sight, both men and
women.
</p>

<p>
They were sitting on the ground, propped against the
palisades or the walls of their huts, in attitudes which
recalled the attitude of the negro, seen long before in
the photograph in the Irish hotel.  One of the men,
rising unsteadily to his feet, walked towards them for
some half-dozen paces, paused, seemed to forget, and
sank down again, with a nodding head.  A child, rising
up from a log, crawled towards a hen.  The hen,
suspecting him, moved off.  The child watched it strut
away from him as though trying to remember what he
had planned to do to it.  He stood stupidly, half asleep.
Slowly he laid himself down upon the ground, with the
movement of an old man careful of the aches of his
joints.  It seemed to Roger that the child had never
really been awake.  It was the slow deliberate
movement of the child which convinced him, through his
fever, that he was in the presence of the enemy.
"These people have sleeping sickness," he said.  The
words seemed to echo along his brain, "sleeping
sickness, sickness, sickness."  This was what he had come
out to see.  Here was his work cut out for him.  This
was sleeping sickness.  Here was a village down with
it.  It was shocking to him.  Had he been in health it
would have staggered him.  These sleepers were never
going to awake.  All these poor wasting wretches were
dying.  He had never seen death at work on a large
scale before.  He checked a half-formed impulse to bolt
by stepping forward into the enclosure, into the reek
of death.  The place was full of death.  He drove
Merrylegs before him.  Merrylegs knew the disease.
Merrylegs had no wish to see more of it.  He was for
bolting.  "Go on, Merrylegs," said Roger.  "Sing out
to them."
</p>

<p>
Merrylegs got no answer.  "Only dead men here,"
he said.  "Young men, no catch him, run."
</p>

<p>
"Come on round the huts then," said Roger.
"We'll see how many have run."  They went to the
hut from which the smoke rose.
</p>

<p>
An old, old hideous woman was crouched there over
a little fire.  She was trembling violently, and
mumbling with her gums.  She cowered away from Roger
with a wailing cry, very like the cry of a rabbit caught
by a weasel.  "Tiri," she said, "tiri," expecting death.
Merrylegs asked her questions; Roger tried her.  It
was useless.  She did not understand them.  She
mumbled something, shaking her poor old head,
whimpering between the words.  Roger gave her a doll,
which she hugged and whimpered over.  She was like a
child of a few months old in the body of a baboon.
They tried another hut.
</p>

<p>
From the number of food pots stored there, Roger
guessed that this hut had once belonged to a chief.
Two women lay there, one in the last stages of the sickness,
very ill, and scarcely stirring, the other as yet only
apathetic.  She blinked at them as they entered the
hut, without interest, and without alarm, just like an
animal.  She might once have been a comely woman,
but the drowsiness of the sickness had already brought
out the animal in her face.  Her ornaments of very
thin soft gold shewed that she was the wife of an
important person; she may perhaps have been the chief's
favourite.  She did not understand Merrylegs' dialect,
nor he hers.  Possibly, as sometimes happens in the
disease, she had no complete control over her tongue.
Roger thought that she might be thirsty.  He poured
water for her.  She did not drink.  It occurred to
Roger then that she might be welcoming the disease,
giving way to it without a struggle, after losing
husband and child.  He could see that she had had a child,
and there was no child there.  "Poor woman," he said
to himself.  "Poor wretch."  They went out into the
open again.
</p>

<p>
At the further end of the village Roger found
evidence which helped him to make a theory of what had
happened.  Just outside the palisade were the bones of
a few bodies, which, as he supposed, were those who
had died, after the first breaking out of the epidemic.
If the epidemic had begun two months before, as seemed
likely, these men and women must have been dead for
about a fortnight.  The sickness and mortality had
steadily increased since then.  The able, uninfected
inhabitants, had at last migrated together.  They had
gone off with their arms and cattle to some healthier
place, leaving the infected to die.  He could make no
other explanation.  Many of the huts were deserted.
In others, still living sleepers lay among corpses.
Three young men, a boy, and an old man were the
liveliest of the remaining inhabitants.  Roger had only to
look at their tongues to see that they, too, were sealed
for death.  The tongue moved from the root with a
helpless tremor.  Their lymphatic glands were swollen.
They themselves were under no delusions about their
state.  The cloud was on them.  They would not speak
unless they were spoken to with some sharpness.  They
were gloomily waiting until the ailment should blot
everything away from them.  Merrylegs tried to
understand them; but gave it up.  "Very poor men," he
said.  "Know nothing."  They were some relic (or
outpost) of a strange tribe, speaking an unknown
tongue.  Perhaps they were the descendants of some
little wandering band, separated from its parent tribe,
by war, pestilence, or mischance.  They had had their
laws, their arts, their customs.  They had even thriven.
The game of life had gone pleasantly there.  Life there
had been little more than a sitting in the sun, between
going to the river for a drink and to the patch for a
mealie.  The beauties had sleeked themselves with oil,
and the strong ones had made themselves fat with
butter.  They had lived "naturally," like plants or
animals, sharing the wild things' immunity from ailments.
They were completely adjusted.  Now some little
change had altered their relations to nature.
Something had brought the trypanosome.  Now they died
like the animals, deserted by their kind.
</p>

<p>
The first shock of the sight of this harvest of death
came upon Roger dully, through the shield of his fever.
He did not realise the full horror of it.  Nor was he
conscious of the passage of time.  He stayed in the
village for a full hour before he returned to the boat.
In that hour he made rough notes of the twenty-nine
cases still present there.  Sixteen of them, he hoped,
might yield to treatment.  The others were practically
dead already from wasting.  The preparation of the
notes, brief as they were, was a great drain upon his
strength.  The fever was gaining on him.  He found
himself staring vacantly between the writing of two
words.  His brain was a perpetual surging tumult.
His eyes seemed to burn in their sockets.  He
remembered Lionel with a great start.  "Lionel," he
repeated.  "I must tell Lionel.  We shall stop here."
</p>

<p>
Outside the infected village he looked for tracks.  A
track led towards the ruin.  Another led away across
the plain.  Both were as narrow as a horse's girth, and
beaten as hard as earthenware.  The old tracks of
cattle crossed them.  Merrylegs, looking about upon the
ground, cried out that the tribe had gone over the plain
with their cattle ten or eleven days before.  He pointed
to marks on the ground.  Roger took his word for it.
</p>

<p>
He climbed into the stern-sheets of the boat, feeling
as though hot metal were being injected into his joints.
"How are you now, Lionel?" he asked.  "You're
looking pretty bad.  This is a plague spot.  They've
got the sickness here.  They're dying of it."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't you have come and told me before this?"
said Lionel.  "I've been lying here not knowing
whether you were dead or alive."
</p>

<p>
"I'd a lot of huts to examine," he answered.  "What
do you think?  We had better stop here, eh?  We had
better make this our station.  The first thing I shall do
will be to get you into a bed."
</p>

<p>
"That's like you," said Lionel.  "You make plans
when I'm sick and can't veto them.  My God, if I'd
known it was going to be like this!  Well, I'll never
work with a griff again."
</p>

<p>
"It's time for your medicine," said Roger stolidly, in
order to change the subject.  He poured the white powder
into a cigarette paper, and handed it to the patient.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you dare to give me medicine," Lionel
answered, knocking the dose away.  "I believe you're
poisoning me.  I've watched you.  You're poisoning me."
</p>

<p>
"Don't say things like that, Lionel," said Roger.
"You're awfully tired, I know, but they hurt.  I wish
I could get you well," he mused.  "It's not so easy as
you seem to think," he added.
</p>

<p>
"What isn't?"
</p>

<p>
"Life here."
</p>

<p>
"That's because you're such a silly ass.  I'm all
right.  I only want to be left alone.  Well.  Get the
men ashore, can't you?  Get some sort of a camp
pitched."
</p>

<p>
"I am going to," said Roger.  "I am going to camp
on the hill there for to-night, among the ruins."  He
gave some orders.
</p>

<p>
Lionel sat up.  "Merrylegs," he said, "drop that.
I command here."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Heseltine," said Roger.  "I must do this."
</p>

<p>
"You shall not wreck the expedition," said Lionel.
"You're as ignorant as a cow.  You haven't even
examined the ruin."
</p>

<p>
Roger paid no attention to him.  He bade the men
moor the boat and unload her.
</p>

<p>
"Naldrett," said Lionel, "if you persist in this&mdash;when
I'm sick and can't stop you&mdash;it's the end of our
working together.  We part company.  Put down that
box, Merrylegs.  Leave those things in the boat."
</p>

<p>
Roger had more strength left in him than his
companion.  The boat was unloaded.  The bearers, leaving
a pile of boxes by the river, formed an Indian file and
marched with their burdens of necessaries towards the
hill.  Lionel walked, supported by Roger.  He did not
speak.  His face worked with the impotent anger of a
sick man.  Presently Roger noticed that he was crying
from mere nervous weakness.  He felt that it would be
well to say nothing.  Lionel's petulance was the result
of fever.  If he said anything, the petulant mood would
surely twist it into a cause of offence.  He said nothing.
Lionel, after pausing a minute, said something in a
faint voice about the heat.  Roger had not noticed the
heat.  He had a glowing lime-kiln within him.  He
stopped, and asked if it were very hot.  "God!" said
Lionel disgustedly.  They walked on, following the
bearers.  Presently Lionel stopped and swore at the
heat.  Roger waited.  Each moment of waiting was
torture to him.  Each moment of physical effort racked
him.  He wanted to fling himself down and let the fever
run its course.
</p>

<p>
"God Almighty!" said Lionel, turning on him.
"Can't you answer me?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know you spoke to me."
</p>

<p>
"You don't know anything."
</p>

<p>
"You were not speaking to me, you were swearing
at the heat."
</p>

<p>
"What if I were."
</p>

<p>
"If you could manage to keep quiet till we are
camped," said Roger, "you'd feel better.  I'm doing
my best for you."
</p>

<p>
"You are," said Lionel, "you are.  I'm dying to see
the sort of rotten camp you'll make when you're left
by yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Shut up," said Roger.  "Shut up.  I'm too ill to
talk."  The fever was whirling in him now.  He could
not trust himself to say more.  He was near the
delirious stage.  He remembered smelling the smell of
death, in a foul sultry blast, while Merrylegs said
something about the kraal in the hollow.  Looking,
half-drowsed, to his left, he saw a kraal littered with dead
and dying cattle, among which gorged vultures perched.
Afterwards, he remembered the ruins of a wall,
standing now about three feet high.  It was built of good
hewn stone, well laid, with one crenellated course just
below its present top.  He could never remember
getting over the wall.  There were many sunflowers.
Immense orange sunflowers with limp wavy petals.
Sunflowers growing out of a litter of neatly wrought stones.
Mosquitoes came "pinging" about him, winding their
sultry horns.  Those little horns seemed to him to
be the language of fever.  They suggested things to
him.  The men were a long, long time pitching the
tent.  Something was wrong with one of the men.
The other men were keeping apart from him.  The
beds with their nettings were ready at last.  Fire was
burning.  Something with a smell of soup was being
cooked.  In his sick fancy it was the smell of
something dead.  He told them to take it away.  He saw
Lionel somewhere, much as a man at the point of
death may see the doctor by his bedside.  He could
not be sure which of the two of them was the living
one.  Then there came a moment when he could not
undo the fastening of his mosquito net.  He saw his
bed inside.  He longed to be in bed.  All this torture
would be over directly he was in bed, wrapped up.
But he could not get in.  The bed was shut from him
by the mosquito net.  He wanted to get in.  He would
give the world to be in bed.  But he did not know how
he was to move the netting, everything smelt of death
so strongly.  It was very red everywhere, a smoky,
whirling red, with violent lights.  People were crossing
the dusk, or rather not people, but streaks of darkness.
They were making a great crying out.  They were too
noisy.  Why could they not be quiet?  He ceased to
fumble at the net.  He began to see an endless army
of artillery going over a pass.  The men were all dark;
the guns were all painted black; the horses were black.
They were going uphill endlessly, endlessly, endlessly.
He cried out to them to stop that driving, to do
anything rather than go on and on and on in that ghastly
way.  Instantly they changed to tsetses, riding on dying
cattle.  They were giant tsetses, with eyes like
cannonballs.  An infernal host of trypanosomes wriggled
around them.  The trypanosomes were wriggling all
over him.  A giant tsetse was forcing his mouth open
with a hairy bill, so that the trypanosomes might
wriggle down his throat.  A flattened trypanosome, tasting
as flabby as jelly, was swarming over his lips.
</p>

<p>
The fit passed off in the early morning, leaving him
weak, but alert.  Something was going to happen.  The
air was as close as a blast from a furnace.  He sat up,
holding by the tent-pole.  He could see a star or two.
He wished that the horrible smell would go.  It seemed
to be everywhere.
</p>

<p>
"Lionel," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said a faint voice.
</p>

<p>
"Have you slept?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I've had a long sleep.  How are you?"
</p>

<p>
"The fit's gone.  But I feel queer.  Something's
going to happen."
</p>

<p>
"It's very close.  It will pass off before morning.
Fever plays the devil with one, doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Are you quite better now?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I shall be all right now.  You'll be all right
after some breakfast.  It isn't so bad here, is it?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Not so bad.  But there's this smell of death,
Lionel."
</p>

<p>
"That's fever.  That will pass away, you'll find."
</p>

<p>
"Was I delirious?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  A little."
</p>

<p>
"You were pretty bad."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I was pretty bad all yesterday," said Lionel.
"It's horrible when one gets into that state.  One is
so ashamed afterwards.  It is part of the sickness.
You were awfully gentle with me, Roger."
</p>

<p>
"I saw that you were pretty bad.  We shall have to
get to work to-morrow, and get things into order.  They
are in a bad way in the village there.  There are
twenty-nine cases left.  We might save sixteen of them."
</p>

<p>
"Is there any trace of how they got it?  Do they know?"
</p>

<p>
"They don't talk any language known to Merrylegs."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  What are they like?  Are they a good lot?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  They are good type negroes.  They look as
if they might have something better in them than negro
blood.  Something Arabian.  And there's this ruin here."
</p>

<p>
"It will be fun looking at the ruin.  I wonder if it's
like the Rhodesian ruins.  I've seen those.  If it is,
there ought to be gold here.  Wrought gold as well as
crude.  But we mustn't think of that."
</p>

<p>
"No.  Let's have no side-issues.  I suppose we'd
better start an isolation camp to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Get them all out and burn the village.  Then
we'll start the treatment."
</p>

<p>
"It would be rather a feather in our caps if we found
a tsetse-cide.  A bird would be better than nothing.
Or an ichneumon-fly to pierce the pupæ."
</p>

<p>
"I was young myself once," said Lionel.  "I know
exactly how it feels."  There was a pause after this.
Lionel seemed to chuckle.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you go to sleep again, Lionel?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  It's too close."
</p>

<p>
"It's jolly looking at the stars.  And I can see right
out into the wilderness.  The moon is wonderful.  It is
very vast out here.  And lonely.  It gives one a strange
sense of being full of memories.  I wonder who built
these ruins."
</p>

<p>
"Phoenicians, I suppose.  In Africa one puts
everything down to Phoenicians.  In the Mediterranean it
used to be some other fellows; now it's Iberians.
Aryans had a great vogue forty years ago; but they're
dead, now.  Then there were those sloppy Celts.  It'll
be the Hittites when we get back."
</p>

<p>
"Did you see Great Zimbabwe?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But they're all called Zimbabwe.  It's a
native name for ruins.  It's an uncanny place.  It lies
all open.  There's no roof to it.  None of them have
any roof.  Nothing but great high walls, and two hideous
cones of stone, and a lot of corpses under the floors.
There are ancient gold workings all around it.  It is
said to be an astronomical temple, as well as the site
of a great mining town.  Do you know much about
astronomy?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I know Sirius."
</p>

<p>
"I know Sirius.  Can you see him?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't see it from here.  Perhaps it isn't visible."
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me to be clouding up.  Listen."
</p>

<p>
"Is that a lion roaring?"
</p>

<p>
"Jump out a minute."  Lionel was turned out,
standing at the door of the tent.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" Roger asked.
</p>

<p>
"A thunderstorm," said Lionel.  "Get on your
things.  I prepared for this.  Wrap that tarpaulin
round you, and come on out.  Don't wait.  Come on."
</p>

<p>
Outside in the night the heavens were fast darkening
under a whirling purplish cloud.  From time to time
the expanse of cloud glimmered into a livid reddish
colour with the passage of lightning.  It was as though
the whole lower heaven lightened.  Thunder was rolling.
Great burning streaks tore the sky across, loosing
thunder and flame.  Roger saw the bearers moving from
their fire to the shelter of the lee of the ruins.  A faint
sultry blast fanned against his face, bringing that smell
of death to him.  He turned away, choking.  "Get
away from the tent," Lionel shouted in his ear, over the
roar of the thunder.  "Tie this rope round me.  It's
going to be bad.  Get under the lee of the wall there.
Run."  They hurried to the shelter, on the tottering
legs of those who have just recovered from fever.  As
they ran, Roger trod on something rope-like and
moving, which (squirming round) struck his boot with a
sharp tap.
</p>

<p>
"There's a snake," he cried, giving a jump.
</p>

<p>
"Did he get you?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Only my boot."
</p>

<p>
"Lucky for you.  There may be death-adders here.
Rattle with your feet.  Here we are.  This will do."
</p>

<p>
There came a sharp pattering of heavy rain-drops,
which beat the ground like shot falling on to tin.  In
the glimmer of a long flash, which burnt for a full ten
seconds, Roger saw Lionel probing the ground for snakes
with an outstretched foot.  He was hooded and cowled
with tarpaulin from the boat.  He was scratching a
match, sleepy with heat-damp, to get a light for a
cigarette.  The match flared, putting the face in strong
colour below the shade of the cowl.  The sky was being
charged by a dark host.  There came a sort of elemental
sighing, as the obscuring of the vertical stars
began.  Out of the whole air came the sighing.  It was
a noise like waterfalls and pine forests.  Then with a
shattering crash the storm burst.  The whole sky broke
into a blaze, as though a vast bath of fire had suddenly
been hurled over.  There was a roaring as of the earth
being split.  After an instant's pause, there came an
explosion so terrific that the two men huddled up
together instinctively.  It grew colder on the instant.
It grew icy cold.  The tent stood out clearly, in every
detail, for a few bright seconds.  Then the rain poured
down, as though the bottom of the sky had broken.
The next flash shewed only a streaming greyness of
water, pouring down, with a weight and force new to
Roger.  It was a blinding rain, one could not face it.
It made the world one grey torrent.  It made the earth
paste beneath the feet.  Brooks were rushing down the
hill within half a minute of its beginning.  The flashes
and thundering never ceased.  Crouching up to the
wall, Roger could only gulp air that was half water.
The force of the storm staggered him.  The fury of
the thunder daunted him.  The splendour of the
lightning was so ghastly that at each blast he bent back
against the wall.  A tree was struck on the wall above
him.  He expected to be struck at each flash.  There
was no question of bravery.  The racket and the glare
were worse than the fiercest shell-fire.  The lightning
seemed to run across the sky and along the ground,
and out of the ground.  One smelt it.  It had the smell
of something burning; some metal.
</p>

<p>
The next instant he was digging his fingers into the
crenellations to save himself from being blown away.
The wind came swooping down with a rush which beat
the breath out of him.  For one second the rain seemed
to pause.  It was merely changing its direction to the
horizontal.  The air seemed to be no longer present.
There was nothing but a rushing, stinging, blinding
torrent of water.  After the wind began, Roger was not
properly conscious of anything.  He stood backed up to
the wall, with his eyes and mouth tight shut, his ears
buffeted and streaming, his nose wrinkled by the effort
to keep his eyes shut.  Across his eyelids he sensed the
glimmer of the lightning, now blinding, now merely
vivid.  Everything else was leaping, howling uproar,
driving wet, driving cold, dominated by the explosions
aloft.  All confusion was left loose to feed the fear of
death in him.  So they stood shoulder to shoulder, for
something like an hour, when a change came.
</p>

<p>
The wind died away, after blowing its fiercest.  The
rain stopped.  The livid glimmering of the lightning
passed off into the distance.  The stars came out.
Roger squelched about in the mud, trying to get some
sensation into his freezing feet.  Lionel's teeth were
chattering.  Lionel with numbed fingers was trying to
light a sopping match for the sodden cigarette already
between his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty bad one," said Lionel.  "The tent's gone."
</p>

<p>
"It will be dawn soon," said Roger, looking at the
wreck of the tent.  "It's over now."  He shivered.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," said Lionel.  "That's only half of it.
There's the other half to come yet.  I wonder how the
bearers took it."
</p>

<p>
"I'll go and see," said Roger.
</p>

<p>
"Stay where you are," said Lionel.  "You won't
have time."  The moon shewed for a brief moment&mdash;a
sickly moon already threatened by scud.  The clouds
were rolling up again.
</p>

<p>
"This will be in our faces," said Lionel, raising his
voice.  "These are circular storms."  The wind was
muttering far off.  All the earth was filled with a
gloomy murmur.  "Let's get into the wreck of the
tent," Lionel added in a shout.  "Into the wreck of
the tent.  We may die of cold if we don't."  They
hove up the heavy canvas so that they might creep
within, under the folds.  They cowered there close
together, waiting, chilled to the bone.
</p>

<p>
"It's jolly cold," said Roger, with chattering teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Lionel.  "I've known a man die in one
of these.  Hold tight.  Here it comes."
</p>

<p>
It came with such a shock of thunder and fire of lightning
that they both started.  They felt the folds of the
tent surge and lift above them as the wind beat upon it.
Some flap had blown loose.  It flogged at Roger like a
bar of hard wood.  He understood then what sailors
meant by wind.  He felt a sort of exultation for a
moment.  Then one terrible blast flung him on his side,
and rolled a great weight of wet canvas on him.  He
felt it quiver and hesitate.  The wind seemed to be
heaving and heaving, with multitudinous little howling
devils.  They were heaving up and heaving under.
The whole mass hesitated.  He was moved, he was
swayed.  He felt the fabric pause and totter upward
and sink down.  "We're going," he muttered, gulping.
Afterwards, he maintained that nothing but the weight
of the rain kept him from being blown away.  Water
was gurgling in the ground beneath him.  Water was
running up his sleeves, and down his neck.  Water
spouted on him as he beat away the folds to get air.
A grand and ghastly fire was running across heaven.
Shocks were striking the earth all around him.
Another tree was blasted.  Thunder broke out above in a
long rippling crescendo of splitting cracks.  That, and
the pouring of a cataract into his face made him draw
back the fold.  He cowered.  He had lost touch with
Lionel.  He did not know where Lionel was.  His foot
struck something hard.  Groping down, hungry for
companionship, he found that it was the broken
tent-pole.  Another gust lifted him.  It gathered strength.
It swept the folds from his hands and sent the edge
flogging, flogging, flogging, with its lashes of rope and
tent-pegs.  The full fury of the storm was on him.
The tent was bundling itself up into ruin against the
boxes.  He was sitting in wet mud assailed by every
devil of bad weather.  Lionel was by his side shouting
into his ear.  "Don't stand," came the far-away voice.
"Get struck."  He nodded when next the flames ran
round.  It seemed likely that he would be struck.  It
was a quick death, so people said.  He found himself
saying aloud that it would be terrible if Lionel were
struck.  What then?  What would he do then?  He
craned round into the beating rain to try to get a
glimpse of the bearers.  He could see nothing but rain
and that reddish running glimmer of living light.
</p>

<p>
He did not feel much.  He was too cold, too weak,
too frightened.  If he had been able to define his
feelings he would have said that he was thinking it
impossible that he could ever have been dry, or warm, or
happy.  His old life was a far-off inconceivable dream.
That he had ever sat by a fire seemed inconceivable.
That there was such a thing as a sun seemed inconceivable.
That life could be dignified, tender, or heroic
seemed inconceivable.  "If this isn't misery," he
muttered, shaking, "I don't know what is.  I don't know
what is."  He felt suddenly that water was running
under him in a good strong stream, several inches deep.
Putting his hand down, it slopped up to the wrist in a
current.  He groped with his hand.  As he put it down
some beetle in the water pinched him briskly, turning
him sick for a moment with the memory of the snake
which had struck his boot.  Standing up hurriedly, the
water rose above his boots.  Looking up, an opening in
the clouds shewed him the moon, a beaten swimmer in a
mill-race.  The storm was breaking.
</p>

<p>
Not long after that it broke.  The stars came out.
The wind ceased from her whirling about continually.
She blew steady, in a brisk fresh gale, bringing up the
clearing showers.  The showers would have seemed
torrents at other times, but to Roger, now, they were
little drizzles.  Lionel and he found a sort of cave in
the tent.  Part of the canvas had wedged itself under
the pole.  The rest had been blown across a pile of boxes
on to the wall.  Being supported now by those two
uprights it roofed in a narrow shelter about five feet long.
They crept into this shelter, dead beat from the cold.
For a while they sat crouched close together, with
chattering teeth.  Then they drew a few folds of the canvas
over them and lay still, trying to get warmth and sleep.
They were not very sure that they would live to see the
dawn.  Roger thought vaguely of the bearers.  He
wondered what they had done, prompted by their
knowledge of these storms.  A dull, heavy, steady roaring
noise seemed to be coming from the river.  He
wondered if the water had risen much, after all that
torrential rain.  Thinking vaguely of a flood, he wondered
if the boat were safe.  It seemed a long, long time since
they had left the boat.  He must have left the boat in
some other life.  The sun had been shining, he had been
hot, he had passed through a glorious landscape.  He
had seen the peacocks of the Queen of Sheba jetting
among flowers which were like burning precious stones.
That was long ago.  That was over forever.  But yet
he wondered vaguely about the boat.  Was it safe, there
in the broad?
</p>

<p>
"Lionel," he said gently.  "Can you sleep?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  We shall get warm presently."
</p>

<p>
"It's jolly wretched."
</p>

<p>
"It'll be all right when we get warm.  Don't let's
talk."
</p>

<p>
"Is the boat all right, do you think?  The water is
roaring in the river."
</p>

<p>
"The boat?  I can't think about the boat.  She was
moored or something."  Their teeth chattered again for
some little time.  Presently, as they lay there
shivering, they felt the uneasy aching warmth which
sometimes comes to those who sleep in wet clothes.  It is
much such an unpleasant heat as wet grass generates in
a rick.  There is cramp and pain in it.  The muscles
rise up into little knots and bunch themselves.  Still,
it is heat of a kind.  They lay awake, rubbing their
contorted muscles, until, a little before the dawn, they
were warm enough to doze.  They dozed off, then,
waking up, from time to time, generally once in ten
minutes, to turn uneasily, so that the aching muscles might
cease to twist into little knots and bunches.

<p>
The rain ceased before dawn.  When the two
friends felt strong enough to turn out, the sun
was already burning.  It was after half-past
seven o'clock.  The brooks which had washed past them
and over them, only three or four hours before, were
no longer running.  Their tracks were marked on the
hillside, in broad, shallow, muddy ruts, and in paths
of plastered grass.  The river had been over its banks
not long before.  It was swirling along now, brimful,
as red as water from an ironworks.  Roger remembered
the water running by a road near Portobe, from some
ironworks up the hill.  It was just that savage colour.
He felt a qualm of home-sickness.  He turned to blink
at the sun for the pleasure of the warmth upon his face.
</p>

<p>
The camp was a quag of mud.  Red splashes plastered
the boxes.  The tent was half-buried in it.  His
clothes, and the covering tarpaulin, were smeared with
it.  He felt that it had been worked, not only into his
skin, but into his nature.  He had never before known
what it is to be really dirty, nor what continued dirt
may mean to the character.  The site of the camp was
trodden and spattered and beslimed, yet the brightness
of morning made it hard for him to believe that such a
storm had passed over him only a little while before.
He noticed the trees which had been blasted by the
lightning.  It had not all been nightmare.
</p>

<p>
Up the hill, beyond three small circling walls, no
taller than the wall beside him, rose up the great central
walls.  They stood out clearly in the strong light.
They were good, well-built walls, with crenellated
courses near the top, in the right artistic place, in the
inevitable place.  The crenellations shewed Roger that
he was not widely removed from the builders, in spirit.
They talked the universal language of art.  But they
were more than talkers, these old men.  Their work was
splendid.  It had style.  It had the impress of will
upon it.  The idea had been thought out to its simplest
terms.  The walls were solid with that simple strength
which the efficient nations of antiquity, not yet
corrupted by sentiment, affected, in public building.
Though they were not like Roman work, they reminded
Roger of walls at Richborough and Caerwent.  There
was something of the same pagan spirit in them,
something strong, and fine, and uncanny.  Even with the
flowering shrubs and grass clumps on them, these walls
were uncanny.  He shivered a little.  The lonely hill
had once been a city, where strong, fine, uncanny brains
had lived.
</p>

<p>
Lionel crawled out.  "Where's Merrylegs?" he
asked.  "Why haven't they brought our tea?"
</p>

<p>
Roger started.  Where were the bearers?  He had
not seen them since he had noticed them go to cover
before the bursting of the storm.  They had gone.
They had not come back.  They had not even lighted
a fire.  "I don't know where they are," he said.
"Where can they be?"
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you seen them?" said Lionel.
</p>

<p>
"No," he answered.  "They're not here.  Merrylegs!"
he shouted.  "Merrylegs!"  No answer came.
</p>

<p>
Lionel's face changed slightly.  He jumped on to the
low wall, and looked downhill towards the village.  The
view over that waste of pale grass, through which the
river ran, was very splendid; but Lionel was not
looking for landscape.  "Give me the glasses," he said.
He stared through them for several minutes, sweeping
the plain.  "Run up into the ruins, Roger," said
Lionel.  "They may be there."
</p>

<p>
"Wait one minute," said Roger.  "There is smoke
in the village.  That is too big a fire for the people
whom I saw there to have made."
</p>

<p>
"Wet wood," said Lionel promptly.  "Come on.
We must get these boys into order."
</p>

<p>
They hurried up the hill, calling for Merrylegs.
After a couple of minutes Roger stopped.  "Lionel,"
he said.  "During the storm, or just before it, I saw
them go to shelter under the lee of the wall there.
Their tracks will be in the mud.  We could follow them
up in that way."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Lionel.  "They're not up here, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
After some little search, they found where the
bearers had sheltered before the storm threatened.  A
vulture shewed them the exact place.  Two other vultures
were there already.  The storm had killed one of the
men.
</p>

<p>
"It's Eukwo, the lazy one," said Lionel.  "I noticed
last night that there was something the matter with him.
Perhaps you saw how the others fought shy of him.
These fellows are like animals, aren't they, in the way
they leave their sick?"  He looked at the body.
"Dysentery and the cold, I suppose," he said.  "With
Kilemba dead last night, the village full of dead down
below us, the storm, then this fellow dying, it has been
too much for them.  I'm afraid, Roger, that the men
have deserted us."
</p>

<p>
"Gone?" said Roger blankly.  It had not occurred
to him before as a possibility.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid," said Lionel, moving away.  "Here is
where they sheltered for the storm.  There are their
tracks leading downhill.  You see?  Here.  See?
Still half full of water.  They cleared out in the night
during the showers.  They've got three or four hours'
start of us."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Roger.  "Come on.  We'd better eat
as we go.  Otherwise we may never catch them up."
</p>

<p>
"They'll have gone in the boat," said Lionel.
"With this flood they'll be a day's march downstream.
There's no trace of the boat in the lagoon there."
</p>

<p>
"She may have been swept away," said Roger, after
a glance through the glasses.  "The stores are there
still."  By this time they were hurrying downhill
towards the village.  Both were thinking how fiercely
they would thrash Merrylegs and how little chance there
was of finding any Merrylegs to thrash.  Anger burned
up in hot bursts, and the cold water of despair put
it out again.  Roger felt it more keenly than Lionel.
He was less used to the shocks of travel.  He wondered,
as he hurried, what stores had been left in the boat,
and what had been piled on the bank to be carried up
next day.  He had been ill; he had never noticed.  The
men had done as they pleased.  He reproached himself
so bitterly that he hardly dared look at his friend.  He
wondered whether the men had taken anything of
supreme importance.  He feared the worst.  If they had
taken anything important he would be to blame.  It
was his fault.  He ought to have guarded against this.
He ought to have taken the paddles.  He ought to have
ordered the men to bring everything up to camp, where
it would have been under his own eyes.  Lionel looked
at him quizzically.
</p>

<p>
"Don't cross the river till you reach the water," he
said.  "We may catch them.  They may not have gone."
</p>

<p>
On their way they looked through the village.  The
bearers were not there.  Lionel tried to make the
villagers understand him by signs; but they were too
strongly infected to understand a difficult thing.  He
had to give them up.  He bade Roger fill his pockets
with some bruised corn which they found in one of the
pots of an empty hut.  They munched this as they
went.  Their next task was to run out the trail.
</p>

<p>
By the village drinking-place the river had
overflowed the bank.  It had torn up a couple of trees,
which now lay branches downward in the water,
arresting wreckage.  It had surged strongly against the
boxes, driving them from their place, but not destroying
them.  It had heaped them with drift, and coloured
them a yellowish red.  The footmarks of the bearers
were thickly printed in the mud there.  They must have
arrived there in the early morning, when the waters
were beginning to fall.
</p>

<p>
"They've been busy," said Roger.  All the boxes
had been broken open.  Their contents were tumbled
in the mud in all directions.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," said Lionel.  "What do you make of
these marks?" In one place the mud had been planed
smooth in a long plastering smear, ending in a notch
or narrow groove.
</p>

<p>
"That was made by the boat," said Roger.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Lionel.  "That was the boat.  You can
see the puncture in the mud there.  That was made by
the projecting screw in the false nose.  You remember
the screw we put in at Malakoto?  They shoved off
here."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  No doubt.  That is the screw.  So they've
sampled the goods and gone."
</p>

<p>
"That is so.  They've robbed us and run away."
</p>

<p>
"And we are stranded in the heart of the wilderness?"
</p>

<p>
"We are alone, three hundred miles from any white
man."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Then we are alone," said Roger.  "We are
alone here."  The words thrilled him.  They were
meaning words.
</p>

<p>
"We can't go after them," said Lionel.  "They've
got too big a start."
</p>

<p>
"We've got no boat to go in."
</p>

<p>
"I wish," said Lionel, "I wish these riverine negroes
used canoes."
</p>

<p>
"They don't."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Lionel.  "They don't.  Well.  It's no
good moping."
</p>

<p>
"We could follow downstream," said Roger, "and
perhaps catch them at Malakoto."
</p>

<p>
Lionel shook his head.  "There are the swamps," he
said.  "And we've both got fever on us.  I doubt if
we could get through.  We might."
</p>

<p>
"We shall have to try it in the end, if we are to get
away at all."
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking that," said Lionel.  "But when
we try it, it will be the end of the dry season,
when the swamps will be passable.  The swamps
now are as bad as they can be.  Honestly, Roger,
I don't think we could make Malakoto, carrying
our own stores.  It's ten days; and those others
wouldn't stay at Malakoto, remember.  They'd make
for Kisa.  No.  Best give in.  They've won the
trick."
</p>

<p>
"And we're to lose all these stores; about a hundred
pounds' worth of stores?"
</p>

<p>
"That's the minimum, I'm afraid."
</p>

<p>
"It's a bad beginning," said Roger.  He walked to
and fro, fretting.  "Doesn't it make your blood boil?"
he continued.  "Look at the way the brutes have tossed
the things about.  I'd give a good deal to have a few
of them here."
</p>

<p>
Lionel sat down on a box and stared meditatively at
the wreck.  "Roger," he said at length.  "Have you
any idea what stores were brought up the hill last
night?"
</p>

<p>
"Mostly the bow-stores, I suppose; provisions,
bedding, and camp gear."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I was afraid," said Lionel.
</p>

<p>
"What are you afraid of?"
</p>

<p>
"Come on.  Let's face it," said Lionel, springing
from his perch.  "We must get these things out of the
mud.  We must see how we stand."
</p>

<p>
"You mean we may be&mdash;  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"We must see what stores are left to us."
</p>

<p>
They set to work together to pick up the wreck.
They began with cartridges, which had been scattered
broadcast in wantonness.  Many were spoiled; many
missing.  Marks on the grass shewed that others had
been carefully emptied, so that the thieves might have
the brass shells enclosing the charges.  Still, a good
many were to be found.  The two men recovered about
fifty rounds of Winchester, and eighty rounds of
revolver ammunition.  With what they wore in their belts
this amount was reassuring.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," said Roger.  "Here's a box of slides.
They're all smashed."
</p>

<p>
"Was the microscope not brought up?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Roger.  "It was in a box with
a blue stencil."
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Lionel.  "I've been looking out for
it.  I thought it wasn't here.  Look.  Over there.
There's part of a lid with a blue stencil.  Is that the
lid for the microscope?"
</p>

<p>
"No, that's a drugs lid."
</p>

<p>
"They can't have taken it with them.  Surely they
wouldn't take a microscope."
</p>

<p>
"It might be up in the camp all this time."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  True.  Wait.  We'll get these things out of
the mud, and then we'll go up the hill, and make a list
of what is missing.  Here's our stationery ruined.  All
our nice clean temperature charts that I set such store
by.  I told you life was wasteful out here.  All your
pressed plants are done for."
</p>

<p>
"Here are clothes, of sorts.  Jaeger underwear."
</p>

<p>
"Fish them out.  We'll wash them afterwards."
</p>

<p>
They quartered the expanse of red slime.  It was a
sort of Tom Tiddler's ground, littered with European
goods.  They worked quickly, racing the sun.  From
time to time there came hails of "The tool-chest's gone.
Here's the lid."  "Your small stores won't be much
good, the soap's melted or something."  "Look at what
these brutes have done to the sugar."
</p>

<p>
Presently Lionel hailed.
</p>

<p>
"I say.  I say.  Have you come across any drugs?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Only the lid of a drugs box."
</p>

<p>
"Well.  It's getting serious.  There's no other box
here.  We must go on back to camp and find out if
they are there."
</p>

<p>
"We shall be done, without drugs," said Roger.
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk about it, my dear man," said Lionel.
"Don't talk about it."
</p>

<p>
"It would be worth while making a raft," said Roger.
"There are a couple of axes in camp.  If we worked
hard all morning, we could get a sort of a raft built.
We could use the tent-ropes for lashings.  Then we
could easily rig up a sail.  We should catch them up by
dusk, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"There are points about the raft theory," said Lionel,
as they set out for camp.  "But there are so many
creeks and gullies where they could hide, and then there
are the crocks."
</p>

<p>
"We could build a sort of bulwark of boxes."
</p>

<p>
"We'll find out about the drugs first.  No.  If we
go working hard in the sun we shall get fever
again."  He wrinkled his brows.  He was anxious.  "I hope
those drugs are all right," he said.  "I don't mind the
guns; but our drugs are portable life."
</p>

<p>
Roger glanced uneasily at Lionel.  He had got to
know him pretty well during the last few months.  He
had come to know that though he was sometimes
irritable, he was very seldom given to despondent speech.
Now he was talking anxiously, from the selfish standpoint
of "I."  Roger thought of the precious bottles of
atoxyl, worth a good deal more than a guinea an ounce.
Lionel's remark was true.  They were portable life.
And if the atoxyl were gone, their mission was at an
end.  No.  It was worse than that.  If the atoxyl were
gone, Lionel was in danger.  For suppose the
trypanosomes recurred in him, as they might, in this hot
climate?  Suppose Lionel developed sleeping sickness
and died, as the people in the village were dying, before
they could win to civilisation?  He did not find any
answer to the problem.  Hoping to distract Lionel, he
began gallantly to talk of the Phoenicians, about whom
he was sufficiently ignorant to escape attention.
</p>

<p>
In the camp things were as they had been, except
that they were drier.  They turned over the boxes,
looking eagerly for blue stencil.
</p>

<p>
"Here's the microscope," said Roger.  "Or I think
it is."  He prized the case open with the jemmy on the
end of the peg-maul.  "Yes.  The microscope's all
right.  Some of our test-tube things are smashed.
Some of the media.  There are plenty of those, though,
down in the mud.  That's one thing to the good.
What's in the case there?"
</p>

<p>
"Anti-scorbutics here."
</p>

<p>
"And in the long box?"
</p>

<p>
"Grub of different kinds."
</p>

<p>
"Here you are, then.  Here's a drugs case."
</p>

<p>
"Saved!"
</p>

<p>
"Shall I open it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, open it.  We did a very foolish thing, Roger.
We ought to have packed each box as a miniature
equipment, so as to minimise the importance of any
losses.  It's in my mind that all our atoxyl is in one
case."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Roger.  "It was in three cases.  One of
them, I know, was in the boat.  I was sitting on it
most of yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Well.  Open that one, and let's see where we stand."
</p>

<p>
The well-fixed screws were drawn.  The box lay open
to the sun, exuding a faint, cleanly smell of camphor.
</p>

<p>
Lionel looked over the drug pots, muttering the
names: "Mercury bi-chlor, sodium carb, sodium
chlor, sodium cit, corrosive sublimate, quinine, quinine,
quinine, potassium bromide&mdash;we shan't want much
of that&mdash;absolute alcohol, carbolic, first-aid dressings,
chlorodyne, morphia, camphorated chalk for the teeth,
what's this?&mdash;digitalis.  What the devil did they send
that for?  There's no atoxyl here."
</p>

<p>
"Nor that other stuff, the dye, trypanroth?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  We didn't order any.  It wasn't altogether a
success with me, and it wasn't being so well spoken of."
</p>

<p>
"That's unfortunate.  But wait a minute.  I see
another drug case.  Over there, against the wall.  Isn't
that a drug case?"
</p>

<p>
"It is.  Chuck the jemmy over."  He did not wait
to draw the screws.  He prized the lid off with two
quick wrenches of the jemmy.  He looked inside.
</p>

<p>
"A quaker," he said grimly, after one look.  "It's a
quaker case."
</p>

<p>
"What's a quaker?"
</p>

<p>
"This case here is what we call a quaker.  Why?
Because it makes one quake.  Look at these bottles.
They're full of paper and sawdust.  Look at this one.
Old rags.  Here's a 2-lb. atoxyl bottle, for which we
paid twenty-eight pounds, not to speak of the duty.  It's
full of dust like the rest."
</p>

<p>
"But, good Lord, Lionel!  Where could it have been
done?  Who could have done it?  We got these direct
from the very best London house."
</p>

<p>
"There were rats on the way," said Lionel.  "You
remember we stopped off a day at that place Kwasi
Bembo, where we hired Merrylegs?  Well.  This was
probably done at Kwasi Bembo by one of those foreign
storekeepers.  An easy way of making money for them."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how he did it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he could have done it easily enough, while we
were having our siestas.  It doesn't matter much,
though, where it was done, does it?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't despair yet," said Roger.  "There must be
another box somewhere.  Here.  Open this one.  The
stencil is ground off.  What's inside this one?"
</p>

<p>
"It looks promising," said Lionel.  "It's screwed;
it isn't nailed.  Off, now."  He thrust the lid away
with a violent heave.  Roger peered in anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing but stones in this one," said Lionel.
"Not even our bottles left.  We'd better open all our
cases, and find out what else has been taken.  I suppose
that's our last box of chemicals?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the last here."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said Roger.  "We won't despair.
Let's see what is left to us."  They examined the other
cases.  They made out an inventory of their possessions.
They learned that they were left in the heart of Africa
with provisions for three months, forty pounds' weight
of anti-scorbutics, a quantity of clothing, a moderate
supply of ammunition, two rifles, two revolvers, a
shotgun, many disinfectants, an assortment of choice drugs,
some medical instruments, and a microscope.  Of medical
comforts they had sparklets, tobacco, soap, matches,
and two bottles of brandy.  Of quaker cases they found,
in all, five, all of them purporting to be either
chemicals or cartridges.  Of utensils they had a tin basin,
plates, and pannikins.  For shelter they had a tent with
a broken pole.
</p>

<p>
"Lionel," said Roger, when they had checked their
list.  "Look here.  We've been up here a good hour
and a half.  The water will have fallen a foot or more.
By the time we have cooked and eaten breakfast it
will have fallen another foot.  It is quite possible that
by that time there will be some more goods, perhaps,
even, some more cases, left high and dry on the bank.
We won't worry about our loss till we know it.  If we
breakfast now we shall be strong enough to bear whatever
may be coming to us.  Let's get a fire started.
We'll brew some tea and sacrifice a tin of soup.  Let's
be extravagant and enjoy ourselves."
</p>

<p>
They were sufficiently extravagant over breakfast,
but they got little enjoyment out of it.  They had
rankling anger in them, against their enemies, known
and unknown.  When their anger gave them leave,
they felt, low down, a chilling, sinking fear that their
plans for the saving of life would come to nothing, that,
in short, their expedition was a failure.
</p>

<p>
"Lionel," said Roger.  "Do you think that the fraud
of the atoxyl was done in London?  Surely Morris and
Henslow wouldn't do a thing like that?"
</p>

<p>
"Who knows what they won't do?" said Lionel
gloomily.  "I know that some contractor or other
always supplies shoddy of some kind to an expedition
to one of the Poles.  Why not to us?  There is always
the chance that the expedition won't return.  And
even if it does return, the fraud is quite likely not to
become known to the public.  And even if the case
comes on in a law court, who can prove it?  There are
too many loopholes.  It is almost impossible to bring
the guilt really home.  The contractor practically never
gets found out.  As for a contractor being punished, I
don't suppose it has ever happened.  It makes one
believe in hell."
</p>

<p>
"It's not the crime itself," said Roger.  "Not knowing
the criminal, I cannot judge the crime; but it's the
state of mind which sickens me.  The state of mind
which could prompt such a thing."
</p>

<p>
"It's a common enough state of mind," said
Lionel.  "In business it's common enough.  Business
men, even of good standing, will do queer things when
the shoe begins to pinch.  You may say what you like
about war.  Business is the real curse of a nation.
Business, and the business brain, and, oh, my God, the
business man!  Swine.  Fatted, vulpine swine."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Roger.  "It is very important not
to take these things into the mind, even to condemn
them."
</p>

<p>
"And I say it is nothing of the sort," said Lionel.
"I believe in strangling ideas as I believe in strangling
people.  You writers, when you are really good at your
job, don't condemn half enough."
</p>

<p>
"Tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner."
</p>

<p>
"Intellectually, not morally.  Come on.  We are
not going to argue.  We are going to work.  We've got
to bury that bearer.  Where's the spade?"
</p>

<p>
They dug a grave for Kukwo, and buried him, and
heaped a cairn of stones from the wall on top of him.
It was burning midday when they had finished.  They
had leisure then to think again of the loss of their
atoxyl.
</p>

<p>
"We may not have any at all?" said Roger.  Lionel
produced a small screw-top bottle from his pocket.  It
had once contained tabloids of anti-pyrin.  It was now
about half full of a white powder.
</p>

<p>
"I've a few doses here," he said.  He looked at it
carefully.  "With luck," he said, "we could cure two
or three cases with this."
</p>

<p>
"But suppose you have a relapse yourself, Lionel?
You must keep some, in case you should relapse."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't relapse," he said carelessly.  "Relapses
aren't common."
</p>

<p>
"But you might.  And you are more important than
a village-full of negroes.  More important than all the
blacks put together and multiplied by ten."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see it.  Look here.  I tell you one thing
which is pretty plain to me.  We've got to set to work
to find an anti-toxin.  First, though, we'll go down and
grope in the mud for anything which may be left.  I
don't give up hope of finding some atoxyl even now."
</p>

<p>
They told each other as they went that they didn't
expect to find anything.  Really their hearts beat high
with expectation.  They were sure of finding what they
sought.
</p>

<p>
They went down to the mud so sure that their
disappointment almost unmanned them.  For they were
disappointed.  An hour of broiling work only added
two cartridges to their store.  Out in the river, caught
in a snag with other drift, they saw a floating packing-case,
marked with a blue stencil.  By the manner of its
floating they judged it to be empty, or nearly empty.
It had probably floated off shortly after being opened.
It had been caught in a snag.  It had then ducked and
sidled to get away.  Lastly, it had turned upside down
and emptied its contents into the river.  So they
judged the tragedy, viewing the victim through their
glasses, from a distance of a hundred yards.
</p>

<p>
"That settles it, I think," said Lionel.  A projecting
snout rose at the box, tilting it over.  It fell back,
lipping under, so that it filled.  In another instant it was
gone from sight.  The glasses showed a slight swirl in
the water.  The swirl passed at once, under the drive
of the spate.  Their last hope of atoxyl was at an end.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Roger hopelessly.  "It's as well to
know the worst.  The box was empty, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Lionel.  "I couldn't be sure."
</p>

<p>
"We might find some things in the water when the
river sinks a little further," said Roger, without much
conviction.  "It'll be drying up very soon now.  Then
we shall find whatever is in it."
</p>

<p>
Lionel sat down despondently, resting his chin on one
hand.  He was letting his disappointment work itself
off silently.  His heart had been set so long on this
first great medical field-day that he could not look
Roger in the face.  The loss of the atoxyl was less hard
to bear than the loss of all the interesting cases over
which he would have been bending at that minute had
this ghastly thing not happened.  And, being an old
campaigner, and therefore forethoughtful, it was bitter
to him to find himself thwarted unexpectedly by a trick
so simple.  He had thought that he had guarded against
all the known dodges.  He had been on his guard all
through.  In London he had sampled the food, the
clothes, the cartridges, rejecting everything which
seemed even faulty.  He had been surprised at his
own strictness.  All the way up from the coast he had
watched his stores so jealously that he had thought
himself safe.  He had been vain of his success.  He had
never lost so little in any previous expedition.  Now
an attack of fever, a storm, and a bearer's sudden death
had let him in for this.  He was not forgetting the
chemist's share.  He cursed himself for having trusted
the chemist.  Then he decided that it was not the
chemist.  The fraud had been committed in Africa.
He had not been careful enough.  He himself was to
blame.  "Guns and grub I could understand," he
cried.  "But for them to take drugs!  Who would
have thought of their taking drugs?  Why didn't I see
that Africa is getting civilised?  Roger, I want to kill
somebody."
</p>

<p>
"It's my turn to lecture now," said Roger.  "We'll
carry these things up to camp.  I've an idea about
camp."
</p>

<p>
"What is your idea?"
</p>

<p>
"To build a house out of the loose stones of the wall.
We could use the wall itself for one wall, build up three
others and roof it with the tent.  It would be better
than having another night like last night."
</p>

<p>
"It might be done," said Lionel, mechanically filling
his pockets with cartridges.  "But I don't know what
good we're going to do here if we haven't any atoxyl.  I
wish I knew who it was.  If ever I touch at Kwasi
Bembo again, I'll have that atoxyl out of his liver."
</p>

<p>
They passed a broiling afternoon carrying their gear
to camp.  They became irritable at about four o'clock.
After that time they worked apart, avoiding each other.
At six Roger made tea, over which they made friends.
At seven they set about the building of their house.
They laboured by moonlight far into the night, laying
the mortarless stones together.  When they knocked off
for bed it was nearly midnight, and the house was far
from perfect.  They could not do more to it.  They
were too tired.  After flogging their blankets against
the walls to get rid of mud and "bichos," they turned
in, bone-weary, and slept the stupid sleep of sailors for
nearly eleven hours.
</p>

<p>
They finished their house in the afternoon.  It was
not a very good house, but they judged that it would be
safer and drier than their tent had proved.  After they
had finished it, they felt it to be structurally weak.
They went at it again.  They strengthened the roof
with saplings, and laid great stones upon the edges of
the canvas cover, so that it should not blow from its
place.  With great cunning Roger arranged an outer
roof of a rough thatch which he himself made from the
osiers used by the natives.  He thought that a double
roof would be cooler.  He explained to Lionel an
ambitious scheme for a thatched verandah; but this had
to be abandoned from want of encouragement.  Inside,
the house was about twelve feet square.  When
the two beds, the table, the chairs, and the boxes were
all within doors, it seemed very cramped and poky.
They were in some doubt about a name for it.  Lionel
was for "Phoenician Villa," Roger for "The Laurels"
or "Oak Drive."  Finally they decided on "Portobe,"
which they smeared over the door in blacking.  They
had not thought much of Portobe on their way up
country.  Portobe.  Roger going out that night, after
supper, to wash the plates in a bucket, sat by the fire for
many minutes, "thinking long" about Portobe.  Something
made him turn his head, and look out into the
night north-north-westward,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  for there dwelt love, and all love's loving parts,<br />
  And all the friends.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It was a dim expanse, mothlike and silver in the moonlight,
reaching on in forest and river to the desert.  To
reach Portobe he would have to go beyond the desert,
over the sea, over Spain, over France.  He paused.
He was not sure whether France would be in the direct
line.  If it were not, then there would only be the sea
to cross, past Land's End, past Carnsore, past Braichy,
past all the headlands.  Then on to the Waters of
Moyle, which never cease to call to the heart who hears
them.  He remembered the poem of the calling of the
Waters of Moyle.  He knew it by heart.  It was a
true poem.  The vastness and silence of the night were
over him.  The great stars burned out above.  They
seemed to wheel and deploy above him, rank upon rank,
helm on gleaming helm, an army, a power.  There were
no birds, no noise of beasts, no lights.  Only the earth,
strange in the moon; the great continent, measureless
in her excess.  She was all savage, all untamed, a black
and cruel continent, a lustful old queen, smeared with
bloody oils.  She frightened him.  He thought of one
night at Portobe three years before, when he had come
out "to look at the night" with Ottalie.  He could
still see some of the stars seen then.  He could still, in
the sharpened fancy of the home-sick, smell the spray
of honeysuckle which had gone trailing and trailing,
drenching wet, across the little-used iron gate which led
to the beach.  He longed to be going up the beach, up
the loaning overhung with old willows, as he had gone
that night with Ottalie.  He longed to be going through
the little town, past the fruitman's, past the butcher's,
past the R.I.C. barracks, to the little churchyard by
the stream.  Ottalie lay there.  Here he was in Africa,
trying to do something for Ottalie's sake.  He drew
in his breath sharply.  It was all useless.  It was not
going to be done.  The atoxyl was lost.  They might
just as well have stayed in England.  He sighed.  To
do something very difficult, which would tax all his
powers, that was his task.  When that was done he would
feel that he had won his bride.  A strange, choking
voice came from the house.
</p>

<p>
"Roger!  Roger!  Come in.  Where are you?"  Lionel
had been asleep in his chair.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?  What is it?" said Roger.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  Nothing," said Lionel.  "I dreamed I
was fast by the leg.  You don't know how beastly it was."

<p>
The next day they walked to the village,
prepared for an unpleasant morning.  They
buried seven bodies and burned eleven huts.
Several times, during the day, they noticed tsetse at
rest on the framework of the huts.
</p>

<p>
"They have followed people up from the water,"
said Lionel.  "They don't attack us, because we are
wearing white duck.  They don't like white."
</p>

<p>
"Flies have an uncanny knowledge," said Roger.
"How do they get their knowledge?  Is it mere
inherited instinct?  I notice that they always attack in
the least protected spots.  How do they know that a
man cannot easily drive them from between his
shoulders?  They do know.  I notice they nearly always
attack between the shoulders."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  And dogs on the head, cattle on the shoulders,
and horses on the belly and forelegs.  They're
subtle little devils."
</p>

<p>
"And they have apparently no place in the scheme
of the world, except to transplant the trypanosome from
where he is harmless to where he is deadly."
</p>

<p>
"Lots of men are like that," said Lionel.  "You can
go along any London street and see thousands of them
outside those disgusting pot-houses.  Men with no place
in the scheme of the world, except to transplant
intoxicants from the casks, where they are harmless, to their
insides, where they become deadly, both to themselves
and to society.  Any self-respecting State would drown
the brutes in their own beer.  Yet the brutes don't get
drowned.  And as they do not, there must be a scientific
reason.  Either the State must be so rotten that
the germs are neutralised by other germs, or the germs
must have some dim sort of efficiency for life, just as the
tsetses have.  They have the tenacity of the very low
organism.  It is one of the mysteries of life to me that
a man tends to lose that tenacity and efficiency for life
as soon as he becomes sufficiently subtle and fine to be
really worth having in the world.  I like Shakespeare
because he is one of the very few men who realise that.
He is harping on it again and again.  He is at it in
Hamlet, in Richard the Second, in Brutus, Othello.
Oh, in lots of the plays, in the minor characters, too,
like Malvolio; even in Aguecheek.  And people call
that disgusting, beefy brute, Prince Henry, 'Shakespeare's
one hero,' a 'vision of ideal English manhood.'  Shakespeare's
one hero!  Shakespeare wrote him with
his tongue in his cheek, and used an ounce of civet
afterwards."
</p>

<p>
They turned again to their work.  After changing
their clothes, bathing antiseptically, and anointing their
hands with corrosive sublimate solution and alcohol,
they began solemnly to distil some water for their tiny
store of atoxyl.
</p>

<p>
"Lionel," said Roger, "we've got enough drug to
cure two, or perhaps three of these people.  We ought
not to use it all.  We are away in the wilds here.  Save
one dose at least for yourself in case you should get a
relapse.  You know how very virulent a relapsed case is."
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Lionel.  "But that is part of the
day's work.  Our only chance of doing good here is to
find an anti-toxin.  I want this spare atoxyl for that."
</p>

<p>
"But," said Roger, "you cannot make an effective
serum from the blood of a man in whom atoxyl is at
work.  Surely atoxyl only stimulates the phagocytes to
eat the trypanosome."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," said Lionel.  "You're a serumite, I'm
not.  I am not at all keen on the use of serum for this
complaint.  I believe that the cure (if there is one) will
be got by injecting the patient with dead trypanosomes
or very, very weak ones.  I'm going to make a special
artificial culture of trypanosomes in culture tubes.  I
shall then weaken the germs with atoxyl.  When they
are all bloated and paralysed, I shall inject them.  I
believe that that injection, or the injection of quite dead
trypanosomes, will have permanent good effects."
</p>

<p>
"And I," rejoined Roger, "believe that your methods
will be useless.  I believe that the cure (if there be
a cure) will be obtained by the use of sera obtained from
naturally or artificially immunised animals."
</p>

<p>
"That's just the taking kind of fairy story you would
believe.  You're a sentimentalist."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  But listen.  It is said that when the
dogs of the bushmen are reared entirely on the meat of
immune game, they become immune like the game; but
that if they are not used to wild meat they develop
nagana from eating it casually."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe the first part of that," said Lionel.
"It sounds too like a yarn.  The dogs which are reared
entirely on wild game are probably naturally immune
native dogs, bred originally from some wild strain, like
the wild hunting-dogs."
</p>

<p>
"But there is no doubt that wild game, like wildebeests,
koodoos, hyenas, and quaggas, are immune?"
</p>

<p>
"None whatever."
</p>

<p>
"Then could not some preparation be made from the
blood of the wild game?  Surely one could extract the
immunising principle from the immune creature, and
use that as a serum?"
</p>

<p>
"We don't even know what the 'immunising
principle' may be; so how can we extract it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, then.  Use the blood serum by itself."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear man, the blood of these beasts is the
favourite haunt of the trypanosome."
</p>

<p>
They argued it to and fro with the pertinacity
of enthusiasts improperly equipped with knowledge.
Roger fought for his "fairy story," Lionel for his dead
and dying cultures.  At last Lionel finished the
preparation of the mixture.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," he said.  "This atoxyl, you say, is to
be kept?  Well.  If I get a relapse before it is used,
you will please remember that it is to be used to
paralyse artificially-raised trypanosomes, which will
afterwards be injected into me.  You will try none of your
sera on me, my friend.  If you like to go getting sera
from dying, dirty, anthraxy wild beasts, do so; but
don't put any of the poison, so got, into me.  I see you
so plainly strangling a deer in a mud-wallow, and drawing
off the blood into a methylated spirits can.  Here's
the mixture ready.  And now that our water of life is
ready for use, comes the great question: Which of all
these sleepers is to live?  Here are twenty-nine men,
women, and children.  They are all condemned to die
within a few weeks.  Now then, Roger.  You are a
writer, that is to say a law-giver, a disposer and settler
of moral issues.  Which of these is to live?  We can
say thumbs down to any we choose.  If we live to be a
hundred we shall probably never have to make such a
solemn choice again."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't certain life," said Roger, hesitating for
a moment, staggered by the responsibility.  "Atoxyl
isn't a certain cure, even of moderate cases."
</p>

<p>
"It's a practically certain cure if the patient is all
right in other ways; that is, of course, if the case has
not gone too far."
</p>

<p>
"What is the percentage of deaths?" said Roger.
</p>

<p>
"With atoxyl?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Eight per cent. for slight cases, and twenty-two per
cent. for bad ones.  Without atoxyl, it's a certain
hundred per cent."
</p>

<p>
"I see."
</p>

<p>
"It's a good drug."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Roger.  "It's a good drug.  But look
at them, Lionel.  To stand here and choose them out."
</p>

<p>
"We are doing now what the scientist will one day
do for every human race," said Lionel.  "We are
choosing for the future.  As it happens we are choosing
for the future of a fraction of a wretched little African
tribe.  The scientist will one day choose, just as finally,
for the future of man.  I didn't think you'd baulk,
Roger.  This is the beginning of the golden age.  'The
golden age begins anew.'  Here are the wise men
choosing who are to inherit the earth."
</p>

<p>
A sleepy negro came unsteadily from a hut.  He
walked, as though not quite in control of his actions,
towards the wise men.  He was a fine, supple creature,
dressed in crocodile's teeth.  Parts of him shone with
an anointment of oil.  He drew up, dully staring.
His jaw was hanging.  Flies settled on his body.  A
tsetse with fierce, dancing flight, flew round him, and
settled on his shoulders.  He stood vacantly, gazing at
the wise men.  His mind could not be sure of anything;
but there was something which he wanted to say;
something which had to be said.  He waited, vacantly, for
the message to come back to him, and then drove slowly
forward again, and again stopped.  His lips mumbled
something.  His eyes drooped.  One trembling hand
weakly groped in the air for support.  It rested on a
hut.  He slowly and very wearily collapsed upon the
hut, and sat down.  His head nodded and nodded.
Another tsetse flew down.  Roger noticed that the man
was cicatrised about the body with old scars.  He had
been a warrior.  He had lived the savage life to the
full.  He had killed.  He had rushed screaming to
death, under his tossing Colobus plumes, first of his
tribe to stab, before the shields rattled on each other.
He had been lithe, swift, and bloody as the panther.
Now he was this trembling, fumbling thing, a log, a
driveller, a perch for flies.
</p>

<p>
"Lionel," said Roger, "it will be awful if we lose
our cases."
</p>

<p>
"Why?  They will die in any case."
</p>

<p>
"But after choosing them like this.  If we give them
their chance, and they lose the chance.  I should feel
that perhaps one of the others might have lived."
</p>

<p>
"We shall choose carefully.  We can do no more
than that.  There's that hideous old crone coming out
again.  Poor old thing.  I dare say she has seen more
of the world than either of us.  She may be a king's
wife and the mother of kings.  How merciless these
savages are to the old!"
</p>

<p>
"They're like children.  Children have no mercy on
the old."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what good life is to her?"
</p>

<p>
"I dare say she remembers the good days.  She can't
feel very much."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Lionel.  "But I notice that old people
feel intensely.  They don't feel much.  They may feel
only one single thing in all the world; but they feel
about that with all their strength.  It's perfectly
ghastly how they feel.  We are all islands apart.  We
do not know each other.  We cannot know that woman's
mind, nor have we any data by which we can imagine
it.  That old animal may be like Blake's bird: 'A
whole world of delight closed to your senses five.'"
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Would you cure her?  She's not
infected as it happens; but would you, if she were?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  She has had her life.  I wonder, by the way,
if extreme old age is immune from sleeping sickness.
I dare say it is.  But old age is not common in savage
societies.  I wish I knew that old woman's story.  She
has seen a lot, Roger.  That is a wonderful face.  Now
we must choose.  Shall we choose a woman?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Not a woman.  We must think of the creature's
future.  What would become of a woman left
alone here?  Even if she followed up her tribe, they
would probably not admit her.  You know that these
people do not believe in the possibility of a cure for
sleeping sickness.  They would only drive her out, or
kill her."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, or let her drift among white men.  No.  Not
a woman.  Not an old man, I say.  The old have had
their lives.  Besides, the life of an old savage is
generally wretched.  There would be nothing for him to
do, either here or anywhere else.  So we won't have an
old man."
</p>

<p>
"Nor a warrior," said Roger.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure about a warrior," said Lionel.  "He
would be able to fend for himself.  He would be worth
taking in by some other tribe short of males.  There
are points to the warrior."
</p>

<p>
"He would probably rise up one night and jab us
with a shovel-headed spear."
</p>

<p>
"And then we should shoot him.  Yes, that might
happen.  That narrows it down to the boys."
</p>

<p>
They looked at the boys, noting their teeth, skulls,
and physiognomies.  Several shewed signs of
congenital malignant disease; others were brutish and
loutish looking; but they were, on the whole, a much
nicer-looking lot than the boys who sell papers in
London.  They narrowed the choice to four.  One of them
shewed signs of pneumonia.  He was rejected.  The
others were examined carefully.  Their prefrontal
areas were measured.  They were sounded and felt and
summed up.  The matter was doubtful for a time.
The lad with the best head was more drowsy than the
other two.  The question arose, should the doubtful
cure of a genius be preferred to the less doubtful cure
of a dunce.  "Nature has made an effort for this one,"
said Lionel, "at the expense of the type.  This fellow
has got a better head than the others, but he is not quite
so fine a specimen.  That means that he will be less
happy.  Nature would probably prefer the other fellows."
</p>

<p>
"We have nothing to do with Nature," said Roger.
"We are out to fight her wherever we can find her.
Nature is a collection of vegetables, many of them
human.  Let us thwart her.  Nature's mind is the mind
of the flock of sheep.  Nature's order is the order of the
primeval swamp.  Never mind what she would prefer.
Sacrifice both the dunces, and let the other have a
double chance.  I know the dunce-mind, or 'natural'
mind, only too well.  It would sacrifice any original
mind, and brutally, like the beast it is, rather than see
its doltish sheep-pen rules infringed."
</p>

<p>
"Genius is excess," said Lionel.  "Genius in a
savage means an excess of savagery.  This fellow may
be a most turbulent, bloodthirsty ruffian.  The others,
though they will probably be bloodthirsty ruffians, may
not be so turbulent."
</p>

<p>
"If he be turbulent," said Roger, "it will be in a
more intellectual manner than is usual with his tribe.
Turbulence in a savage is a sign of life.  It is only in
a civilised man that it is a sign of failure."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Lionel.  "We will have the
genius.  He may disappoint us.  I think he is the best
type here.  Who is to be the other?  What do you say
to that nice-looking boy, whom we spun some time ago
for itch?  I like that lad's face."
</p>

<p>
"You think he would be a good one to save?"

"Well, itch apart, he looked a nice lad.  He would
be exceptional, socially, just as the other would be
exceptional intellectually.  He would be to some extent
unnatural, which is what you seem to want.  Why are
you so down on the natural?"
</p>

<p>
"I've heard some old women of both sexes praising
the natural, ever since I was a child.  The natural.
The born natural.  The undeveloped sheep in us, which
makes common head to butt the wolf-scarer."
</p>

<p>
"We'll give them a dose to-day and a dose to-morrow,
and a last dose in two and a half weeks' time," said
Lionel.  "And then they'll either be fit to butt
anything in the wide world, or they'll be on their way to
Marumba."
</p>

<p>
"The genius first," said Roger, bringing up the
patient.  The needle was sterilised.  A little prick
between the shoulderblades drove the dose home.  The
other boy followed.  Lionel eyed them carefully.
</p>

<p>
"They must come out of here, now," he said.
"They must live with us for to-night.  We can't do
more now.  We've done enough for one day.  To-morrow
we must rig them up a shanty up on the hill.
They'll be pretty well by to-morrow night."
</p>

<p>
They were doing finely by the next night, as Lionel
had foretold.  Their second dose was followed up with
a preparation of mercury, which the wise men trusted
to complete the cure.  The patients were pretty well.
But the work and excitement of settling them into
quarters near "Portobe" made the doctors very far
from pretty well.  Though the sick-quarters were little
more than a roofed-in wind-screen of tarpaulin, the
strain of making it was too much for two over-wrought
Europeans, not yet used to the heat.  Lionel, complaining
peevishly of headache, knocked off work before tea.
Roger, feeling the boisterous good spirits which so often
precede a fit of recurrent fever, helped Lionel into bed,
and cheerfully did the sick man's share of building.
After this he gave the two patients their supper of
biscuit and bully beef (which they ate with very good
appetites), and, when they had eaten, put them to bed
under their wind-screen.  As he worked, he hoped
fervently that Lionel was not going to be ill again.  He
had been peevish, with a slight, irritable fever all the
way up the river from Malakoto.  If he fell ill again
now, all the work would be delayed.  Roger wanted to
get to work.  All their plans had been upset by the
bearers' desertion.  Any further upsetting of plans
might ruin the expedition.  The days were passing.
Every day brought those poor drowsy devils in the
village nearer to their deaths.  Soon they would be too
ill to cure.  He wanted Lionel well and strong, working
beside him towards the discovery of a serum.  That
was the crying need.  With Lionel ill, he could do
nothing, or nearly nothing.  He had so little scientific
knowledge.  And besides that, he would have Lionel
to watch, and the cleansing and feeding of all those
twenty-seven sick.  He did not see how things were
going to get done.
</p>

<p>
He told himself that things would have to get done,
and that he would have to do them.  The resolution
cheered him, but the prospect was not made brighter by
his discovery soon afterwards that Lionel's temperature
had shot up with a sudden leaping bound to 103°.
That frightened him.  Lionel was not going to be ill, he
was ill, and very dangerously ill already.  His temperature
had risen four or five degrees in about half an hour.
The discovery gave Roger a momentary feeling of panic.
With a fever like that, Lionel might die, and if Lionel
died, what then?  He would be there alone, alone in the
wilds, with drowsed, half-dead savages.  He would be
alone there with death, in the heart of a continent.
He would go mad there, at the sight of his own shadow,
like the Australian in the cheerful story.  But for
Lionel to die, to lose Lionel, the friend of all these days,
the comrade of all these adventures, that was the
desolating thought.  It would not matter much what
happened to himself if Lionel were to die.
</p>

<p>
It was borne in upon him that Lionel's life would
depend on his exertions.  He would be doctor, nurse,
and chemist.  Let him look to it.  On the morrow,
perhaps, there would be two vigorous natives to look to
the sick in the village.  Meanwhile, there was the night
to win through; and that burning temperature to lower.
</p>

<p>
He managed to administer a dose of quinine.  There
was nothing more that he could do.  Crouching down
by the sick man's side made him feel queer.  He
remembered that he had left neither food nor water in
the patients' hut.  They ought to have food by them in
case they woke hungry, as they probably would, after
their long, irregular fast.  He carried them some
biscuit, and a bucket half full of water.  They were
sleeping heavily.  Nature was resting in them.  While
coming back from the hut, he noticed that the night struck
cold.  He shivered.  His teeth began to chatter.  He
felt that the cold had stricken to his liver.  He wished
that he had not gone out.  Coming into the house, he
felt the need of a fire; but he did not dare to light one,
on account of Lionel.  Lionel lay tossing deliriously,
babbling the halves of words.  Roger gave him more
quinine, and took a strong dose himself.  There was
something very strange about the quinine.  It seemed
to come to his mouth from a hand immensely distant.
There was a long, long arm, like a crooked railway, tied
to the hand.  It seemed to Roger that it could not
possibly crook itself sufficiently to let the hand reach his
mouth.  After the strangeness of the hand had faded,
he felt horribly cold.  He longed to have fire all round
him, and inside him.  He regarded Lionel stupidly.
He could do nothing more.  He would lie down.  If
Lionel wanted anything, he would get up to fetch it.
He could not sit up with Lionel.  He was in for a
fever.  He got into his bed, and heaped the blankets
round him, trembling.  Almost at once the real world
began to blur and change.  It was still the real world,
but he was seeing much in it which he had not
suspected.  Many queer things were happening before his
eyes.  He lay shuddering, with chattering teeth, listening,
as he thought, to the noise made by the world as it
revolved.  It was a crashing, booming, resolute noise,
which droned down and anon piped up high.  It went
on and on.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of all the noise he had the strange
fancy that his body was not in bed at all, but poised in
air.  His bed lay somewhere below him.  Sitting up
he could see part of it, infinitely distant, below his
outstretched feet.  The ceiling was swelling and swelling
just above him.  It seemed as vast as heaven.  All the
time it swelled he seemed to shrink.  He was lying
chained somewhere, while his body was shrinking to
the vanishing point.  He could feel himself dwindling,
while the blackness above grew vaster.  He heard
something far below him&mdash;or was it at his side?&mdash;something
or somebody speaking very rapidly.  He tried to
call out to Lionel, but all that he could say was
something about an oyster tree.  There was a great deal of
chattering.  Somebody was trying to get in, or
somebody was trying to get out.  Something or somebody
was in great danger, and, do what he could, he could
not help growing smaller, smaller, smaller.  At last the
blackness fell in upon his littleness and blotted it out.
</p>

<p>
He awoke in the early morning, feeling as though his
bones had been taken out.  His mouth had a taste as
though brown paper had been burnt in it.  Wafts of
foul smell passed over him as each fresh gust blew in
at the doorway.  Something was the matter with his
eyes.  He had an obscurity of vision.  He could not
see properly.  Things changed and merged into each
other.  He lifted a hand to brush away the distorting
film.  He was thirsty.  He was too weak to define
more clearly what he wanted; it was not water; it was
not food; it was not odour; but a bitter, pungent,
astringent something which would be all three to him.  He
wanted something which would cleanse his mouth, supplant
this foulness in his nostrils, and nerve the jelly
of his marrow.  Weakly desiring this potion, he fell
asleep from exhaustion.  He woke much refreshed after
a sleep of about eight hours.
</p>

<p>
When he looked about him, he saw that Lionel was
still unconscious.  He was lying there uneasily,
muttering and restless, with a much-flushed face.  His
hands were plucking and scratching at his chest.
There was that about him which suggested high fever.
Roger hurriedly brought a thermometer and took the
sick man's temperature.  It had sunk to less than 100°.
He thrust aside the pyjama coat, and felt the heart with
his finger.  The pulse was beating with something of
the batting motion of a guttering electric light.  The
chest was inflamed, with a slight reddish rash.
</p>

<p>
Roger sat down upon his bed and took a few deep
breaths to steady himself.  Afterwards he remembered
telling himself in a loud, clear voice that he would have
to go into this with a clear head, a very clear head.
He swilled his head with water from the bucket.  When
he felt competent he remembered another and more
certain symptom.  He advanced to the sick man and
looked anxiously at his throat glands.  He had braced
himself for the shock; but it was none the less severe
when it came.  The glands were visibly swollen.
They were also very tender to the touch.  Lionel had
relapsed.  He was suffering from trypanosomiasis.
The disease was on him.
</p>

<p>
Roger passed the next few minutes biting his lips.
From time to time he went back to the bed to look at
the well-known symptoms.  He was sure, only too sure,
but each time he went he prayed to God that he might
be mistaken.  He went over these symptoms in his
mind.  High temperature, a rapid pulse, the glands of
the neck swollen, a rash on the chest, hands, or
shoulders, a flushed face, and feeble movements.  There was
no doubting the symptoms.  Lionel was in a severe
relapse.
</p>

<p>
Even when one is certain of something terrible, there
is still a clinging to hope, a sense of the possibility of
hope.  Roger sitting there on the bed, staring at the
restless body, had still a hope that he might be wrong.
He dressed himself carefully, saying over and over
again that he must keep a level head.  There was still
one test to apply.  It was necessary to be certain.  He
got out the microscope, and sterilised a needle.  When
he was ready he punctured one of Lionel's glands, and
blew out the matter on to a slide.  Very anxiously,
after preparing the slide for observation, he focussed the
lens, and looked down onto the new, unsuspected world,
bustling below him on the glass.
</p>

<p>
He was looking down on a strange world of discs,
among which little wriggling wavy membranes, something
like the tails of tadpoles, waved themselves slowly,
and lashed out with a sort of whip-lash snout.  Each
had a dark little nucleus in his middle, and a minute
spot near the anterior end.  There was no room for
hope in Roger's mind when he saw those little waving
membranes, bustling actively, splitting, multiplying,
lashing with their whips.  They were trypanosomes in
high activity.  He watched them for a minute or two
horrified by the bluntness and lowness of the organism,
and by its blind power.  It was a trembling membrane
a thousandth part of an inch long.  It had
brought Lionel down to that restless body on the bed.
It had reduced all Lionel's knowledge and charm and
skill to a little plucking at the skin, a little tossing, a
little babbling.  It was the visible pestilence, the living
seed of death, sown in the blood.
</p>

<p>
Roger made himself some tea.  Having made it, he
forced himself to eat, repeating that he must eat to keep
strong, lest he should fail Lionel in any way.  Food,
and the hot diffusive stimulant, made him more cheerful.
He told himself that Lionel was only in a fit of
the frequently recurring trypanosome fever.  After a
day or two of fever he would come to again, weak,
anæmic, and complaining of headache.  A dose of atoxyl
would destroy all the symptoms in a few hours.  Even
if he did not take the atoxyl, there was no certainty
that the fever would turn to sleeping sickness.  There
was a chance of it; but no certainty.  A doctor's first
duty was to be confident.  Well, he was going to be
confident.  He was going to pull Lionel through.  He
remembered a conversation between two Americans in
a railway carriage.  He had overheard them years
before, while travelling south from Fleetwood.  They
were talking of a coming prize fight between two
notorious boxers who, while training, spent much energy
in contemning each other in the Press, threatening
each other with annihilation, of the most final kind.
"Them suckers chew the rag fit to beat the band," said
one of the men.  "Why cain't they give it a rest?
Let 'em slug each other good, in der scrap.  De hell
wid dis chin music."
</p>

<p>
"Aw git off," said the other.  "Them quitters, if
they didn't talk hot air till dey believed it, dey'd never
git near der ring."
</p>

<p>
He had always treasured the conversation in his
memory.  He thought of it now.  Perhaps if doctors
did not force themselves "to talk hot air" till their
patients believed it, very few patients would ever leave
their beds.  He cleared away the breakfast things and
made the house tidy.  He gave Lionel an extra pillow.
Then he went out into the morning to think of what
he should do.
</p>

<p>
When he got out into the air he remembered the two
patients.  It was his duty now to dose them and give
them food.  All that he had to do was to walk to their
hut, see that they ate their breakfast, and give them
each a blue pill afterwards.  The drug would have
taken a stronger hold during the night, and the action
of atoxyl is magical even in bad cases.  He expected to
find them alert and lively, changed by the drug's magic
to two intelligent merry negroes.  It was not too much
to hope, perhaps.  He prayed that it might be so.
There was nothing for which he longed so much as for
some strong evidence of the power of atoxyl to arrest
the disease.  He topped the rise and looked down on his
handiwork.
</p>

<p>
All was quiet in the clumsy hut.  The negroes were
not stirring.  Roger was vaguely perplexed when he
saw that they were not about.  Even if they were no
better than they had been the day before they ought still
to be up and sunning.  He wondered what had happened.
A fear that the drug had failed him mingled
with his memory of a book about man-eating lions.
He broke into a run.
</p>

<p>
He had only to push aside the tarpaulin which served
for door to see that the two patients had gone.  When
they had gone, there was no means of knowing; but
gone they were.  They had gone at a time when there
had been light enough for them to see the biscuits and
the bucket; for biscuits and bucket were gone with
them.  He could see no trace of the two men on the
wide savannah which rolled away below him.  He
supposed that some homing instinct had sent them back
to the village.  He was cheered by the thought.  They
had been cured within two days.  They had been
changed from oafish lumps into thinking beings.  Now
he would cure Lionel in the same way.  As he hurried
back to "Portobe," he was thankful that some of the
drug remained to them.  He would have been in a
strange quandary had they used all the drug two days
before.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When he began to prepare to give the
injection, he could not find the atoxyl bottle.
He searched anxiously through the hut for
it, but could not find it.  It was an unmistakable glass
bottle, half-full of distilled water, at the bottom of
which lay some of the white sediment as yet undissolved.
The bottle bore a square white label, marked ATOXYL
in big capitals, printed by Lionel with a blue pencil.
Roger could not see it anywhere.  He looked in all the
boxes, one after the other.  He looked in the gun-cases,
under the folds of the tent, in the chinks and crannies,
everywhere.  It was not there.  When he had searched
the hut twice from end to end, in different directions,
he decided that it was not there.  His next thought was
that it must have been left in the hut with the two
patients, and that the patients must have carried it off
as treasure trove.  In that case, perhaps, it would be
gone forever.  He would have noticed it that morning
had it been still in the hut.  Then he thought that it
might still be in the hut.  It might have been put
behind a box.  He might have failed to see it.  It was
necessary to make certain.  He hurried to the hut and
searched it through.  A couple of minutes of searching
shewed him that the bottle was not there.
</p>

<p>
He racked his brains, trying to think what had
become of it.  When had he last seen it?  Lionel and he
had been at the hut during the preceding afternoon.
They had staked in the uprights of the shelter; and had
then knocked off for a rest, as Lionel was not feeling
well.  During the rest he (Roger) had brought the
atoxyl from "Portobe," and had given the second
injection to the two patients.  So much was clear.  What
had happened then?  He tried to remember.  After
that he had gone on with the building, while Lionel had
rested.  He distinctly remembered Lionel sitting down
on the wall-top with the atoxyl bottle in his hands.
What had he done with it after that?  Surely he had
taken it back with him to "Portobe"?  In any case
there could be no doubt that Lionel had been the last
to touch it.  Lionel had taken the bottle to put it away;
and it seemed now only too likely that he had put it
away in a place where no one else could find it.
</p>

<p>
Roger tried to remember exactly how ill Lionel had
been when he had gone back to "Portobe."  He
remembered that he had been flushed and peevish, but he
could not remember any symptoms of light-headedness.
He had crept off alone while Roger was fixing a
roof-ridge.  Roger, suddenly noticing that he had gone,
had followed him to "Portobe," and had found him
sitting vacantly on the floor, staring with unseeing eyes.
It was certain that the atoxyl bottle was not with him
then.
</p>

<p>
"If that were so," said Roger to himself, "he must
have dropped it or put it down between 'Portobe' and
this.  Here is where he was sitting.  This is the path
by which he walked.  Is the bottle anywhere on the
path, or near it?"  It was not.  Careful search showed
that it was not.  "Well," said Roger to himself, "he
must have thrown it away.  The fever made him
desperate or peevish for a moment, and he has thrown it
away.  Where could he have thrown it?"
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately there was a wide expanse over which
he might have thrown it.  If he had thrown it downhill
it might have rolled far, after hitting the ground.  If
he had thrown it uphill, it might have got hidden or
smashed among the loose stones from the ruins.  Having
satisfied himself that Lionel for the moment was not
appreciably worse, Roger started down the village to
find his two patients.  He thought that if they could be
made to understand what was missing, the search for
the bottle might be made by three pairs of eyes instead
of by one.  Some possibility, or, to be more exact, some
hope of a possibility, of the bottle being in the
possession of the patients, occurred to him.  The thought that
perhaps Lionel's life depended on the caprice of two
cheerful negro-boys made him tremble.
</p>

<p>
There was no trace of the patients in the village.
They were not there, nor was Roger enough skilled in
tracking to know whether they had been there.  As
they were not there, he could only suppose that, on
finding themselves whole, among the wreck of their
tribe, they had set out to follow their fellows by the
tracks left by the cattle.  He thought it possible that
they might return soon, in a day or two, if not that very
day.  But there was not much chance of their returning
with the atoxyl bottle, even if they had set out with
it.  He figured to himself the progression of a bottle
in the emotional estimation of a negro who had never
before seen one.  First, it would appear as a rich
treasure, something to be boldly stolen, but fearfully prized.
Then it would appear as something with cubic capacity,
possibly containing potables.  Then, after sampling of
the potable, in this case unpleasant, it would be emptied.
Its final position ranged between the personal ornament
and the cock-shy.  Meanwhile, Roger had the sick to
feed.
</p>

<p>
After that he returned to Lionel.  Lionel's temperature
had dropped slightly, but he was hardly conscious
yet.  Roger left him while he began the weary, fruitless
search over a space of Africa a hundred yards long
by eighty broad.  He measured a space forty yards on
each side of the track between the hut and "Portobe."  If
the bottle had been thrown away, it had been thrown
away within that space.  It was unlikely to have fallen
more than forty yards from the track.  A squat short-necked
bottle is not an easy thing to throw.  If it were
not there, then he would have to conclude that the
patients had taken it.  It was a long, exhausting
search.  It was as wearisome as the search for lost ball
at cricket.  But in this case the seeker knew that his
comrade's life depended on his success.  He paced to
and fro, treading over every inch of the measured
ground, beating it beneath his feet, stamping to scare
the snakes, feeling his blood leap whenever he struck a
stone.  The sun filled earth and sky with wrinklings of
brass and glass at white, tremulous heat, oozing in discs
from his vortex of spilling glare.  Many times in the
agony of that search Roger had to break off to look to
Lionel, and to drink from the canvas bucket of boiled
water.  He prayed that Lionel might recover consciousness,
if only for a minute, so that he might tell him in
which direction the bottle had been flung.  But Lionel
did not recover consciousness.  He lay in his bed,
muttering to himself, talking nonsense in a little, low,
indifferent voice.  The most that Roger could say for
him was that he was quieter.  His hands were quieter;
his voice was quieter.  It was nothing to be thankful
for.  It meant merely that the patient was weaker.
</p>

<p>
After it was over, Roger thought that his search for
the lost bottle was the best thing he had ever done.  He
had trampled carefully over every inch of the measured
ground.  He had taken no chances, he had neglected no
possible hole nor tussock.  A wide space of trodden
grass and battered shrub testified to the thoroughness
of his painful hunt.  And all was useless.  The bottle
was not there.  The atoxyl was lost.
</p>

<p>
Once before, several years past, Roger had watched
the approaching death of one intimately known.  He
had seen his drunken father dying.  He had not loved
his father; he had felt little grief for him.  But the
sight of him dying woke in him a blind pity for all poor
groping human souls, "who work themselves such
wrong" in a world so beautiful given for so short a
time.  He had looked on that death as though it were a
natural force, grave and pitiless as wisdom, hiding some
erring thing which had been at variance from it.  He
had thought of Ottalie's death, down in the cabin,
among the wreck of the supper-tables.  In his mind he
had seen Ottalie, so often, flung down on to the rank of
revolving chairs, and struggling up with wild eyes, but
with noble courage even then, to meet the flood shocking
in to end her.  That death seemed a monstrous, useless
horror to him.  Now a link which bound him to Ottalie
was about to snap.  He was watching the sick-bed of a
man who had often talked with her, a man, who had
known her intimately.  Lionel, with the simple, charming
spirit, so like in so many ways what Ottalie would
have been had she been born a man, was mortally sick.
The sight of him lying there unconscious struck him to
the heart.  That mumbling body on the bed was his
friend, his dear comrade, a link binding him to
everything which he cherished.  A veil was being drawn
across his friend's mind.  He was watching it come
closer and closer, and the house within grow dark.  In
a little while it would be drawn down close, shutting
in the life forever.  If he did not act at once it would
be too late; Lionel would die.  If Lionel were to die,
he would be alone in Africa, with that thing on the
bed.
</p>

<p>
He knelt down by the cot in a whirl of jarring
suggestions.  What was he to do?  Anxiety had lifted him
out of himself on to another plane, a plane of torturing
emotion.  He felt a painful clearness of intellect and
an utter deadness of controlling will.  His ideas
swarmed in his head, yet he had no power to select from
them.  He saw so many things which he might be
doing; building a raft to take them to Malakoto, making,
or trying to make, a serum, to nullify the infection;
there were many things.  But how could he leave
Lionel in this state, and how was he to get Lionel out
of this state?  He told himself that large doses of
arsenic might be of use; the next moment he realised
that they would be useless.  He had tried to make
Lionel take arsenic on the voyage upstream, as a
prophylactic.  Lionel had replied that arsenic was no
good to him.  "Trypanosomes," he had said, "become
inured to particular drugs.  Mine got inured to arsenic
the last time I was out here.  If my trypanosomes
recur you'll have to try something else."  What else was
he to try?
</p>

<p>
He had read that marked temporary improvement
shows itself after a variety of treatments, after any
treatment, in fact, which tends to improve the health
of particular organs.  He tried the simplest and least
dangerous of those which he remembered.  It could do
no harm, in any case.  If it did good, he would feel
braced to try something more searching.
</p>

<p>
The mere act of administering the dose strengthened
him.  Action is always a cordial to a mind at war with
itself.  At times of conflagration the fiddle has saved
more than Nero from disquieting thought, tending to
suicide.  When at last he had forced his will to the
selection of a course, he felt more sure of himself.  He
set about the preparation of food for the patient, and,
when that was made and given, he sterilised his hands
for the beginning of the delicate task of culture-making.
He had plenty of tubes of media of different kinds.
He selected those most likely to give quick results.
They were media of bouillon and agar.  One of them, a
special medium of rabbit's flesh and Witte's peptone,
had been prepared by Lionel months before, in
far-distant London.  Roger remembered how they had
talked together, in their enthusiasm, during the making
of that medium.  He had had little thought then of
the circumstances under which it would come to be
used.  He had never before felt home-sick for London.
He was home-sick now.  He longed to be back in London
with Lionel, in the bare, airy room in Pump Court,
where the noise of the Strand seemed like the noise of
distant trains which never passed.  He longed to be
back there, out of this loneliness, with Lionel well again.
The memory of their little bickerings came back to him.
Travel is said to knock off the angles of a man.  If the
man has fire in him, the process may burn the fingers
of those near him.  Little moments of irritation, after
sleepless nights, after fever, after over-exertion, had
flamed up between them.  No Europeans can travel
together for many hundreds of miles in the tropics
without these irritable moments.  They derive from
physical weakness of some kind, rather than from any
weakness of character, though the links which bind the
two are, of course, close and subtle.  He told himself
this; but he was not to be comforted.  The memory
of those occasional, momentary jarrings gave him keen
pain.  If Lionel got over this illness, he would make it
up to him.  He thought of many means by which he
might make their journey together more an adventure
of the finer character.  "Lionel," he said, aloud,
looking down on the sick man, "I want you to forgive me."
</p>

<p>
There was no sign of comprehension from Lionel.
He lay there muttering nervously.  His skin was hot to
the touch with that dry febrile heat which gives to him
who feels it such a shocking sense of the body's usurpation
by malign power.  His temperature was beginning
to show the marked and dreadful evening rise.  Roger
could guess from that that there would be no improvement
until the morning fall.  After feeling the fluttering,
rapid pulse, and the weakness of the movements of
the hands, he had grave doubts whether the body would
be able to stand the strain of that sudden fall.
</p>

<p>
He dragged up a box and sat staring at Lionel, torn
by many thoughts.  One thought was that these moments
would be less terrible if we could live always in
this awakened sense of the responsibility and wonder of
life.  Life was not a succession of actions, planned or
not planned, successful or thwarted, nor was it a
"congressus materiai" held together for a time by food and
exercise.  It was something tested by and evolved from
those things, which were, in a sense, its instruments, the
bricks with which the house is built.  He began to
realise how hard it is to follow life in a world in which the
things of life have such bright colours and moving
qualities.  He had not realised it before, even when he had
been humbled by the news of Ottalie's death.
</p>

<p>
In his torment he "thought long" of Ottalie.  He
called back to his memory all those beautiful days,
up the glens, among the hills.  Words which she had
spoken came back to him, each phrase a precious stone,
carefully set in his imagination of what the prompting
thought had been in her mind.  Ottalie had lived.  He
could imagine Ottalie sitting in judgment upon all the
days of her life ranked in coloured succession before her,
and finding none which had been lived without reference,
however unconscious, to some fine conception of
what exists unchangingly, though only half expressed
by us.
</p>

<p>
He roused himself.  That was why women are so
much finer than men; they are occupied with life itself,
men with its products, or its management.  Whatever
his shortcomings had been, he was no longer dealing
with the things of life, but with life itself.
</p>

<p>
Here he was, for the first time, squarely face to face
with a test of his readiness to deal with life.  He forced
himself to work again, following the process with a
cautious nicety of delicate care which an older artist
would have despised as niggling and stippling.  From
time to time he stopped to look at Lionel, and to take
the temperature.  The temperature was swiftly rising.
</p>

<p>
After some days the fever left Lionel.  It left him
with well-marked symptoms of sleeping sickness.  The
man was gone.  The body remained, weak and trembling,
sufficiently conscious to answer simple questions,
but neither energetic enough to speak unprompted, nor
to ask for food when hungry.  How long he might live
in that state Roger could not guess.  He might live for
some weeks; he might die suddenly, shaken by the
violent changing of the temperature between night and
morning.  It was not till the power of speech was
checked that the horror of it came home to Roger.
Lionel's monosyllables became daily less distinct, until
at last he spoke as though his tongue had grown too
large for his mouth.  The sight of his friend turning
brutish before his eyes made Roger weep.  The strain
was telling on him; his recurrent fever was shaking
him.  He felt that if Lionel were to die, he would go
mad.  He could not leave his friend.  Even in the
day-time, with the work to be done, he could hardly bear to
leave him.  At night his one solace was to stare at his
friend, in an agony of morbid pity, remembering what
that man had been to him before the closing in of the
veil.  The veil was closing more tightly every day.
Roger could picture to himself the change going on
inside the dead, on the surface of the brain, behind the
fine eyes, so drowsy now.  Such a little thing would
arrest that change.  Two cubic centimetres of a white
soluble powder.  He went over it in his mind, day after
day, till the craving for some of that powder was
more than he could bear.  "Lionel," he would say.
"Lionel, Lionel."  And the drowsy head would lift
itself patiently, and grunt, showing some sort of
recognition.  If Lionel had been a stranger (so he told
himself) it might have been endurable; but every attitude
and gesture of the patient was chained to his inmost life
by a hundred delicate links.  That he had known
Ottalie was the sharpest thing to bear.  In losing Lionel
he was losing something which bound Ottalie to him.
Another torment was the knowledge of his own insufficiency.
He thought of the strongly efficient soldiers
and scientists who had studied the disease.  He loathed
the years of emotional self-indulgence which had
unfitted him for such a crisis.  He longed to have for one
half-hour the knowledge and skill of those scientists,
their scrupulous clinical certainty, their reserve of
alternative resource.
</p>

<p>
In reality he was doing very creditably.  One of the
most marked qualities in his character was that extreme
emotional tenderness, or sensibility, which is so strong,
and in the lack of the robuster fibres, so vicious, an
ingredient of the artistic or generating intellect.  This
sensitiveness had been the cause in him of a scrupulous
aloofness from the world.  It had made him maintain a
sort of chastity of idea, not so much from an appreciation
of the value of whiteness of mind as from an inherent
fastidious dislike of blackness.  As he yielded
more and more to the domination of this aloofness, as
the worker in an emotional art is tempted to do, his
positive activities grew weaker till he had come to seek
and appreciate in others those qualities which, essential
to manly nature, had been etiolated in himself by the
super-imposition of the unreal.  This desire to be
virtuous vicariously, by possessing virtuous friends, had been
gratified pleasantly, with advantage to himself, and
with real delight to those robuster ones who felt his
charm.  But the removal of the friends had shown the
essential want.  The man was like a childless woman,
groping about blindly for an emotional outlet.  In his
misery he found an abiding satisfaction in an intense
tenderness to the suffering near him.  In his knowledge
of himself he had feared that his own bodily discomfort
would make him a selfish, petulant, callous nurse.
Before Lionel had fallen ill, he had been prone to
complain of pains, often real enough to a weak, highly
sensitive nature, exposed, after years of easy living, to the
hardships of tropical travel.  Lionel's illness had
altered that.  It had lifted him into a state of mental
exaltation.  In their intenser, spiritual forms, such states
have been called translation, gustation of God,
ingression to the divine shadow, communion with the higher
self.  They may be defined as states in which the mind
ceasing to be conscious of the body as a vehicle, drives
it superbly to the dictated end, with the indifference of
a charioteer driving for high stakes.
</p>

<p>
Though in this mood he was supported to fine deeds,
he was denied the knowledge of his success in them.
His heart was wrung with pity for the sufferers for
whom he cared so tenderly, day after day; but the depth
of his pity made his impotence to help an agony.  He
saw too plainly that the most that he could do was
nothing.  In the darker recesses of his mind hovered a
horror of giving way and relapsing to the barbarism about
him.  His nerve had begun to tremble under the strain.
What he felt was the recurrence of an intense religious
mood which had passed over his mind at the solemn
beginning of manhood.  He was finding, now, after years
of indifference, the cogency of the old division into good
and evil.  As in boyhood, during that religious phase,
he had at times a strange, unreasonable sense of the
sinfulness of certain thoughts and actions, which to
others, not awakened, and to himself, in blinder moods,
seemed harmless.  He began to resolve all things into
terms of the spiritual war.  All this external horror
was a temptation of the devil, to be battled with lest the
soul perish in him.  Little things, little momentary
thoughts, momentary promptings of the sense, perhaps
only a desire for rest, became charged, in his new
reckoning of values, with terrible significances.  Often,
after three hours of labour in the village, after feeding
and cleaning those drowsy dying children, in the hot
sun, till he was exhausted and sick at heart, a fear of
giving way to the devil urged him to apply to them some
of the known alleviations, arsenic, mercury, or the like.
He would arise, and dose them all carefully, knowing
that it was useless, that it would merely prolong a
living death; but knowing also that to do so, at all costs,
was the duty of one who had taken the military oath of
birth into a Christian race.  He learned that the higher
notes of a whistle pleased those even far advanced in
sleep.  He found time each day to whistle to them
in those few livelier minutes before meals, when the
drowsy became almost alert.  He judged that anything
which stimulated them must necessarily be good for
them.  He tried patiently and tenderly many mild
sensual excitations on them, giving them scent or snuff to
inhale, letting them suck pieces of his precious sugar,
burning blue lights at night before them, giving them
slight electric shocks from his battery.  He felt that
by these means he kept alive the faculties of the brain
for some few days longer.  From Tiri, the wrinkled
old crone, the only uninfected person there, he tried
hard to learn the dialect; but age had frozen her brain,
he could learn nothing from her except "Katirkama."  He
never rightly knew what Katirkama was.  It was
something very amusing, since it made her laugh
heartily whenever it was mentioned.  It had something
to do with drumming on a native drum.  Katirkama.
He beat the drum, and the old body became one nod of
laughter, bowing to the beat with chuckles.
"Katirkama," she cried, giggling.  "Katirkama."  After
Katirkama she would follow him about, holding his
hand, squeaking, till he gave her some sugar.
</p>

<p>
When the work in the village was finished, he used to
walk back to Lionel, whom he would find drowsed, just
as he had left him.  On good days he had some little
experiment to make.  He would repeat some trick or
accidental gesture winch had caught the dying attention
of a native.  If he were lucky, the trick brought back
some lively shadow of Lionel.  Even if it passed away
at once, it was cheering to see that shadow.  More
usually the trick failed.  Having seen the occasional
effect of them, he became studious of tricks which might
help to keep the intelligence alert.  The sight of Lionel
gave him so crushing a sense of what was happening in
the affected brain, that he found it easy to imagine
fancies which, as he judged, would be arresting to it.
The burning of magnesium wire and the turning of a
policeman's rattle were his most successful efforts.
One day, while carefully dropping some dilute carbolic
acid into a chegua nest on Lionel's foot, he found
that the burning sensation gave pleasure.  It seemed
to reach the brain like a numbed tickling.  Lionel
laughed a little uneasy, nervous laugh.  It was the only
laughter heard at "Portobe" for many days.
</p>

<p>
Though his work occupied him for ten hours daily, it
did not occupy the whole of him.  Much of it, such as
the preparation of food and the daily disinfection of the
huts, was mechanical.  His mind was left free to
console itself by speculation as best it could.  His first
impressions of the solitude were ghastly and overpowering.
Waking and asleep he felt the horror of the prospect of
losing Lionel.  It was not that he dreaded the prospect
of being alone.  His fear was religious.  He feared
that the barbarism of the solitude would overpower his
little drilled force of civilised sentiment.  He was
warring against barbarism.  Lionel was his powerful ally.
Looking out from his hut on the hill he could see
barbarism all round him, in a vast and very silent menacing
landscape, secret in forest, sullen in its red, shrinking
river, brooding in the great plain, dotted with bones
and stones.  Even the littleness of an English landscape
would have been hard to bear, but this immensity
of savagery awed him.  He doubted whether he would
be able to bear the presence of that sight without his
ally by him.
</p>

<p>
He knew that if he let it begin to get upon his nerves
he would be ruined.  He took himself in hand on the
second day of Lionel's fever.  His situation made him
remember a conversation heard years before at his
rooms in Westminster.  O'Neill and a young Australian
journalist, of the crude and vigorous kind nurtured
by the <i>Bulletin</i>, had passed the evening in talk
with him.  The Australian had told them of the
loneliness of Australia, and of shepherds and settlers who
went mad in the loneliness on the clearings at the back
of beyond.  O'Neill had said that at present Australian
literature was the product of home-sick Englishmen;
but that a true Australian literature would begin among
those lonely ones.  "One of those fellows just going
mad will begin a literature.  And that literature will
be the distinctive Australian literature.  In the cities
you will only get noisy imitations of what is commonest
in the literature of the mother country."  They had
stayed talking till four in the morning.  He had never
seen the Australian since that time.  He remembered
now his stories of shepherds who bolted themselves into
their huts in the effort to get away from the loneliness
which had broken their nerve.  He must take care, he
said, not to let that state of mind take hold upon
him.
</p>

<p>
He began to school himself that night.  He forced
himself up the hill, into the Zimbabwe, at the eerie
moment when the dusk turns vaguely darker, and the
stars are still pale.  All the dimness of ruin and jungle
brooded malignantly, informed by menace.  Faint
noises of creeping things rustled in the alley between
the walls.  Dew was fast forming.  Drops wetted him
with cold splashes as he broke through creepers.
Below him stretched the continent.  No light of man
burned in that expanse.  There was a blackness of
forest, and a ghostliness of grass, all still.  Out of the
night behind him came a stealthiness of approach, more
a sense than a sense perception.  Coming in the night
so secretly, it was hard to locate.  It had that protective
ventriloquism of sounds produced in the dark.  There
is an animal sense in us, not nearly etiolated yet, which
makes us quick to respond to a light noise in the night.
It makes us alert upon all sides; but with a tremulous
alertness, for we have outgrown the instinctive knowledge
of what comes by night.  Roger faced round
swiftly, with a knocking heart.  The noise, whatever
it was, ceased.  After an instant of pause a spray, till
then pinned, swept loose, as though the talon pinning
it had lifted.  It swept away with a faint swishing
noise, followed by a pattering of drops.  After that
there came a silence while the listener and the hidden
watcher stared into the blackness for what should
follow.  The noise of the spattering gave Roger a sense of
the direction of the danger, if it were danger.  He drew
out his revolver.  Another spray spilled a drop or two.
Then, for an instant, near the ground, not far away,
two greenish specks burned like glow-worms, like crawling
fireflies, like two tiny electric lights suddenly turned
on.  They were shut off instantly.  They died into the
night, making it blacker.  After they had faded there
came a hushed rustling which might have been near or
far off.  When that, too, had died, there was a silence.
</p>

<p>
It was so still that the dripping of the dew made the
night like a death vault.  Terrible, inscrutable stars
burned aloft.  Roger pressed his back against the wall.
Up and up towered the wall, an immense labour, a
cynical pile, stamped with lust's cruelties.  It almost
had life, so seen.  In front was the unknown; behind,
that uncanny thing.  Roger waited, tense, till the
darkness was alive with all fear.  Everything was in the
night there, gibbering faces, death, the sudden cold
nosing of death's pig-snout on the heart.  He swung
his revolver up, over his left elbow, and fired.
</p>

<p>
The report crashed among the ruin, sending the night
rovers fast and far.  Chur-ra-rak! screamed the
scattering fowl.  Roger paid little heed to them.  He was
bending down in his tracks hugging his forehead.  The
hammer of the kicking revolver had driven itself into
his brow with a welt which made him sick.  He groped
his way down the hill again, thinking himself lucky that
the iron had not smashed his eye.  He thought no
more of terror for that night.
</p>

<p>
But the next night it came with the dark.  The old
savage devil of the dark was there; the darkness of
loneliness, the loneliness of silence, the immanent
terror of places not yet won, still ruled by the old unclean
gods, not yet exorcised by virtue.  Looking at it, after
night had fallen, from the door of "Portobe," it seemed
full of the promise of death.  The little rustling noises
were there; the suggestion of stealthy death; the
brooding of it all.  A braver man would have been awed by
it.  It was not all cowardice which daunted Roger.  It
was that animal something not yet etiolated, which on
a dark night in a lonely place at a noise of stirring
makes a man's heart thump like a buck's heart.  To
stare into the blackness with eyes still dazzled from the
camp-fire gave a sense of contrast not easy to overcome.
The comfort of the fire was something, something
civilised, conquered, human.  And the beloved figure lying
ill was one of his own kind, leagued with him against
the inhuman.  The vastness of the inhuman overpowered
his will.  He dared not face it.  Sudden terror
told him of something behind him.  He hurried into
the hut and heaped boxes against the tarpaulin door.
</p>

<p>
The moment of fear passed, leaving him ashamed.
He was giving way to nerves.  That would not do.
He must brace himself to face the darkness.  He forced
himself down the hill to the village, and into the village.
Kneeling down he peered into the hut where old Tiri
rocked herself by a fire of reeds, like the withered
beauty in Villon.  She did not see him.  She was
crooning a ditty.  From time to time, with a nervous
jerk of the arm, she flung on a handful of reed, which
crackled and flared, so that she chuckled.  He was
comforted by the sight of her.  Any resolute endurance of
life is comforting to the perplexed.  He walked back
up the hill without the tremors he had felt in going
down.  Something in the walk, the coolness and quiet
of it, made him forget his fears.  He experienced an
animal feeling of being, for the moment, at one with
the night.  "Surely," he thought, "if man can
conceive a spiritual state, calm and august like the night,
he can attain it."  It might even be that by brooding
solitary, like the night itself, one would arrive at the
truth sooner than by the restless methods left behind.
Standing by the door of his hut again, the darkness
exalted him, not, in the common way, by giving him a
sense of the splendour of nature, but by heightening for
an instant his knowledge of the superior splendour of
men.
</p>

<p>
He stood looking out for a little while before some
rally of delirium called him within to his friend.
Later, when he had finished his work for the night, he
thought gloomily of what his fate would be if the death
of Lionel left him alone there, so many miles from his
fellows.  What was he to do?  How was he to cross
four hundred miles of tropical country to the nearest
settlement of whites?  No civilised man had been there
since the Phoenicians fought their last rearguard fight
round the wagons of the last gold train.  Four hundred
miles meant a month's hard marching, even if all
went well.  He could not count on doing it in less than
a month.  And how was he to live during that month,
how guide himself?  Even in mere distance it was a
hard walk.  It was much such a walk as, say, from the
Land's End to Aberdeen, but with all the natural
difficulties multiplied by ten, and all the artificial helps
removed.  It was going to be forced on him.  He would
have to attempt that walk or die alone, where he was,
after watching his friend die.  He glanced anxiously
at Lionel to see if there were any chance of Lionel's
being dragged and helped over that distance.  He saw
no chance.  He would have to watch Lionel dying.
He would have to try to stave off Lionel's death by all
the means known to him, knowing all the time that all
the means were useless.  Then he would bury Lionel,
after watching him die.  After that he would have to
watch the villagers dying; and then, when quite alone,
set forth.
</p>

<p>
And to what would he set forth?  What had life to
give him, if, as was very unlikely, he should win back
to life?  His life was Ottalie's.  He had consecrated
his talent to her, he had devoted all his powers to her.
The best of his talent had been a shadowy sentimental
thing, by which no great life could be lived, no great
sorrow overcome.  The best of his powers had left him
in the centre of a continent, helpless to do what he had
set out to do.  He had not made the world "nobler for
her sake."  Ah, but he would, he said, starting up, filled
suddenly with a vision of that dead beauty.  He would
help the world to all that it had lost in her.  He must
be Ottalie's fair mind at work still, blessing the world.
So would his mind possess her, creeping in about her
soul, drinking more and more of her, till her strength
was the strength by which he moved.  She was very
near him then, he felt.  He felt that all this outward
world of his was only an image of his mind, and that
she being in his mind, was with him.  His heart was
a wretched heart in Africa, in which a sick man babbled
to a weary man.  But there in his heart, he felt, was
that silent guest, beautiful as of old, waiting in the
half-darkness, waiting quietly, watching him, wanting
him to do the right thing, waiting till it was done, so
that she might rise, and walk to him, and take his hands.
He must not fail her.
</p>

<p>
He turned to the corner in which he felt her presence.
"Ottalie!  Ottalie!" he said in a low voice.  "Ottalie,
dear, help me to do this.  I'm going to fail, dear.
Help me not to."  Lionel moaned a little, turning on his
side again.  A draught ruffled the fire slightly.  No
answer moved in his heart.  He had half expected that
the answer would speak within him, in three short
words.  No words came.  Instead, he felt burningly
the image of Ottalie as he had seen her once up the
Craga' Burn, one summer at sunset.  They had stood
among the moors together, on the burn's flat grassy
bank, near a little drumming fall, which guggled over
a sway of rushes.  Sunset had given a glory to the
moors.  All the great hills rose up in the visionary
clearness of an Irish evening after rain.  A glow like
the glow of health was on them.  It was ruddy on
Ottalie's cheek, as she turned her grave hazel eyes upon
him, smiling, to ask him if he saw the Rest House.
She meant a magic rest-house, said, in popular story,
to be somewhere on the hill up Craga' way.  Roger
had talked with men who claimed to have been beguiled
there by "them" to rest for the night.  Ottalie and
he had narrowed down its possible whereabouts almost
to the spot where they were standing; and she had
turned, smiling, with the sun upon her, to ask him if
he saw it.  They had never seen it, though they had
often looked for it at magical moments of the day.
Now looking back he saw that old day with all the glow
of the long-set sun.  Ottalie, and himself, and the
Craga' Burn, the rush sway trailing, the pleasant, faint
smell of the blight on the patch beyond, the whiff of turf
smoke.  Ottalie.  Ottalie.  Ottalie in the blind grave
with the dogrose on her breast.
</p>

<p>
Living alone fosters an intensity of personal life
which sometimes extinguishes the social instinct, even in
those who live alone by the compulsion of accident.  It
had become Roger's lot to look into himself for solace.
Most of those things which society had given to him
during his short, impressionable life were useless to
him.  He had to depend now upon the intensity of his
own nature.  He reckoned up the extent of his civilisation,
as shewn by the amount retained in his memory.
It amounted, when all was said, when allowance had
been made for the amount absorbed unconsciously into
character, to a variety of smatterings, some of them
pleasant, some interesting, and all tinged by the vividness
of his personal predilection.  He had read, either
in the original or in translation, all the masterpieces of
European literature.  He had seen, either in the
original or in reproduction, all the masterpieces of
European art.  His memory for art and literature was
a good general one; but general knowledge was now
useless to him.  What he wanted was particular knowledge,
memory of precise, firm, intellectual images, in
words, or colour, or bronze, to give to his mind the
strength of their various order, as he brooded on them
menaced by death.  It was surprising to him how
little remained of all that he had read and seen.  The
tale of Troy remained, very vividly, with many of the
tragedies rising from it.  Dante remained.  The Morte
D'Arthur remained.  Much of the Bible remained.
Of Shakespeare he had a little pocket volume
containing eight plays.  These, and the memories connected
with them, were in his mind with a reality not till then
known to him.  Among the lesser writers he found
that his memory was kinder to those whom he had
learned by heart as a boy than to those whom he had
read with interest as a man.  He knew more Scott
than Flaubert, and more Mayne Reid than Scott.
From thinking over these earlier literary idols, with a
fierceness of tenderness not to be understood save by
those who have been forced, as he was forced, to the
construction of an intense inner life, he began to realise
the depth and strength of the emotion of the indulgence
of memory.
</p>

<p>
Thenceforward he indulged his memory whenever his
work spared his intelligence.  He lived again in his past
more intensely than he had ever lived.  His life in
Ireland, his days with Ottalie, her words and ways and
looks, he realised again minutely with an exactness
which was, perhaps, half imaginative.  He troubled his
peace with the sweetness of those visions.  The more
deeply true they were, the more strong their colour;
the more intense the vibration of their speech, the more
sharp was the knowledge of their unreality, the more
bitter the longing for the reality.  He was home-sick
for the Irish hills which rose up in his mind so clearly,
threaded by the flash of silver.  He thought of them
hour after hour with a yearning, brooding vision which
gnawed at his heart-strings.
</p>

<p>
After a few weeks he found that he could think of
them without that torment.  He had perfected his
imagination of them by an intensity of thought.  They
had become, as it were, a real country in his brain,
through which his mind could walk at will, almost as
he had walked in the reality.  By mental effort,
absorbing his now narrowed external life, he could
imagine himself walking with Ottalie up the well-known
waters and loanings, so poignantly, with such precision
of imagined detail, that the country seen by him as he
passed through it was as deeply felt as the real scene.
The solemnity of his life made his imagination of
Ottalie deeper and more precious.  At times he felt her
by him, as though an older, unearthly sister walked
with him, half friend, half guide.  At other times,
when he was lucky, in the intense and splendid dreams
which come to those of dwarfed lives, he saw her in
vision.  Such times were white times, which made
whole days precious; but at all times he had clear,
precise memories of her; and, better still, a truer
knowledge of her, and, through that, a truer knowledge of
life.  He thought of her more than of his work.  In
thinking of her he was thankful that all his best work
had been written in her praise.  "His spirit was hers,
the better part of him."  If he had anything good in
him, or which strained towards good, she had put it
there in the beauty of her passing.  If he might find
this cure, helping poor suffering man, it would be only
a spark of her, smouldering to sudden burning in a
heap of tow.
</p>

<p>
His efforts to make a culture succeeded.  With very
great difficulty he obtained a vigorous culture of
trypanosomes, of the small kind usually obtained by
culture.  He strove to make the culture virulent, by
growing it at the artificial equable temperature most
favourable to the growth of the germ (25° C.), and by adding
to the bouillon on which the germs fed minute quantities
of those chemical qualities likely to strengthen them
in one way or another.
</p>

<p>
It was a slow process, and Roger could ill spare time
in his race with death.  He had grown calmer and less
impulsive since he had left the feverish, impulsive city;
but he had not yet acquired the detachment from
circumstance of the doctor or soldier.  The question
"Shall I be in time?" was always jarring upon the
precept "You must not hurry."  At last, one day when
Lionel had shewn less responsiveness than usual, a
temporary despondency made him give up hope.  He saw
no chance of having his anti-toxin ready before Lionel
died.  He picked up a book on serum therapy, and
turned the pages idly.  A heading caught his eye.
</p>

<p>
"<i>The treatment should begin soon after the disease
has declared itself</i>" ran the heading.  The paragraph
went on to say that the anti-toxin was little likely to
be of use after the toxin had taken a strong hold upon
the patient's system.  The treatment was more likely
to be successful if a large initial injection of the
anti-toxin were given directly the disease became evident.
There it was, in black and white; it was no use going
on.  He had tried all his ameliorative measures, with
temporary success.  Latterly he had tried them
sparingly, fearing to immunise the germ.  He had wanted
to keep by him unused some strong drug which would
hold off the disease at the end.  Now there was nothing
for it but to give the strong drug.  His friend was
dying.  He might burn his ships and comb his hair for
death.  He had tried and failed.
</p>

<p>
The mood of depression had been ushered in by an
attack of fever different from his other attacks.  It did
not pass off after following a regular course, like the
recurrent malaria.  It hung upon him in a constant,
cutting headache, which took the strength out of him.
He sat dully, weak as water, with a clanging head,
repeating that Lionel was dying.  Lionel was dying.
One had only to think for a moment to see that it was
hopeless.  Lionel was going to die.
</p>

<p>
He raised his hand, thinking that something had bitten
his throat.  His throat glands were swollen.  For a
moment he thought that the swelling was only a
mosquito bite; but a glance in the mirror shewed him that
it was worse than that.  The swollen glands were a sign
that he, too, was sickening for death.  His fever of the
last few hours was the initial fever.  Sooner or later he
would drowse off to death as Lionel was drowsing.  He
might have only two more months of life.  Two months.
Ottalie had had two startling, frightened seconds before
death choked her.  So this was what Ottalie had felt
in those two seconds, fear, a blind longing of love for
half a dozen, a thought of sky and freedom, a craving,
an agony, and then the fear again.  He rose up.
"Even if it be all useless," he said to himself, "I will
fire off all my cartridges before I go."  He brought out
the Chamberland filter and set to work.

<p>
After passing some of his cultures through the
filter, he injected subcutaneously the filtrate,
composed of dead organisms and their toxins,
into Lionel's arms and into his own.  Taking one of
the black-faced monkeys, which they had brought with
them for the purpose, he shaved and cleansed a part
of its neck, and injected a weak culture into the space
prepared, after exposing the culture to a heat slightly
below the heat necessary to kill the organisms.  Into
another monkey he injected a culture, weakened by a
slight addition of carbolic.  He had no great hope
that the measure which he was preparing would be
of use; he meant to try them all.  "If I had had more
time," he thought bitterly, "I might have succeeded."  He
had lost so much time in getting the culture to
grow.  As he sealed up the punctures with collodion,
he said to himself that he had tried Lionel's cure, and
that now he was free to try his own personal theories.
He would kill some animal naturally immune, such as
a wildebeest or a koodoo, and obtain serum from it
direct, in as cleanly a manner as he could.  Lionel had
said that such a serum, so collected, would be useless
and probably septic; but who cared for possible
blood-poisoning when the alternative was certain death?
Personally he would prefer a death by glanders to this
drowsy dying.  If he could disable an antelope, he
might be able to obtain the blood by formal antiseptic
methods in sterilised pots.  It would be worth trying.
He had taken serum from a horse in England.  He
knew the process.  Unfortunately the heart of Africa is
not like England, nor is a kicking, horned, wild beast,
tearing the earth to tatters in the death-agony, like a
staid and glossy horse neatly arranged to be tapped.
"Besides," he thought, "the beast may be suffering
from all manner of diseases, or it may hold germs in
toleration which the blood of man could not tolerate.
And how was he to go hunting with an equipment of
sterile pots and pipes on his back?"
</p>

<p>
He liked the notion too well to be frightened by the
difficulties.  It offered the possibility of success; it gave
him hope, and it kept his mind busily engaged.  Even
if he saw no wild game, the hunt would be a change to
him.  He was a moderately good rifle-shot.  The foil
was the only weapon at which he was really clever.  As
he looked to his rifle, he felt contempt for the unreality
of his life in London.  It had been a life presupposing
an immense external artificiality.  How little a thing
upset it!  How helpless he was when it had been upset.
And what would happen to England when something
upset London, and scattered its constituent poisons
broadcast?  He went out to the hunt.
</p>

<p>
The wind blew steadily from the direction of the
forest.  There was no chance of doing anything from that
side.  He could never approach game downwind.  He
would have to cross the river.  He had never tried to
cross the river.  He did not even know if it were
possible.  The thought of the crocodiles and the mere sight
of the swirling flood had kept him from examining the
river.  He had not been near it since he had sought
with Lionel for the atoxyl bottles.  What it looked like
upstream he did not know.  He went upstream to look
for a ford.
</p>

<p>
At a little distance beyond the hill he came upon
something which made him pause.  The earth there
had been torn into tracks by the waters of a recent
thunder-storm.  The cleanness of the cuttings
reminded Roger of the little bog-bursts which he had seen
in Ireland after excessive rains.  In one of the tracks
the rushing water had swept bare the paving of an
ancient road, leaving it clear to the sky for about twenty
yards.  The road was of a hard even surface, like the
flooring of a Zimbabwe.  To the touch the surface was
that of a very good cycling road in the best condition.
The ruts of carts were faintly marked upon it in dents.
The road seemed to have been made of hewn stones,
covered over and bound with the powdered pounded
granite used for the floors of the ruins.  It was five of
Roger's paces in breadth.  The edges were channelled
with gutters.  Beyond the gutters were borders of small
hewn blocks neatly arranged, so that the growths near
the road might not spread over it.  Judging by the
direction of the uncovered part, the road entered the
Zimbabwe through a gate in the west wall.  In the other
direction, away from the Zimbabwe, it led slantingly
towards the river, keeping to the top of a ridge
(possibly artificial), so as to avoid a low-lying tract still
boggy from the flood.  The river made a sharp bend
at the point where the road impinged upon it.  Below
the bend the lie of the bank had an odd look, which
recalled human endeavour even now, after the lapse of so
many centuries.  Greatly excited, Roger hurried up to
look at the place.
</p>

<p>
It had been the port of the Zimbabwe.  The bank
had been cut away, so as to form a kind of dock.  The
stumps of the piles were still in the mud in places.
They were strong, well-burnt wooden piles, such as are
used for jetties everywhere.  By the feel of the ground
on the jetty top there was paved-work not far below it.
A dig or two with a knife blade shewed that this was
the case.  The bank was paved like the road.  Looking
back towards the ruin, Roger could mark the track of
the road running up to the wall.  Even where it was
overgrown he could tell its whereabouts by the comparative
lightness of the colour of the grass upon it.  Beyond
the ruin, running almost straight to the south-east,
he noticed a similar ribbon of light grass, marking
another road.  So this was a port, this Zimbabwe, a
port at the terminus of a road.  The road might lead
direct to Ophir, whence Solomon obtained his ivory
and apes and peacocks.  Probably there were gold
mines near at hand.  This place, so quiet now, had
once seen a gold-rush.  The wharf there had been
thronged by jostlers hurrying to the fields.  The basin
of ill-smelling red mud had once been full of ships.
And what ships?  What people?  And when?  "A
brachycephalic people of clever gold-workers of
unknown antiquity."
</p>

<p>
Just above the "port" the river was extremely
narrow.  Sticking out of the water in the narrow part
were masses of masonry, which may at one time have
served as the piers of a bridge.  They were so close
together that Roger crossed the river by them without
difficulty.  On the other side, as he had expected, the
mark of the road was ruled in a dim line in the direction
of the forest.  The country was rougher on that side.
The line of the road was marked less plainly.
</p>

<p>
Late that afternoon, after an exhausting stalk, he got
two shots at what he took to be a koodoo[*] cow.  He
went forward out of heart, believing that both had
missed.  Bright blood on the grass shewed him that he
had hit her.  A little further on he found the cow down,
with her hindquarters paralysed.  She struggled to get
up to face him, poor brute; but she was too hard hit;
she was dying.  When she had struggled a little, he was
able to close with her, avoiding the great horns.  He
was even able to prepare the throat in some measure for
the operation.  Lastly, avoiding a final struggle, he
contrived to sterilise his hands with a solution from
one of the pots slung about him.  The sight of his hands
even after this made him despair of getting an
uncontaminated serum.  But there was no help for it.  He
took out the knife, made the incision in the throat, and
inserted the sterilised tube.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
[*] It was probably an oryx.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When he turned with his booty to go home, he noticed
a little fawn which stood on a knoll above him, looking
at him.  She stood quite still, so shaded off against the
grasses that only a lucky eye could distinguish her.
She was waiting, perhaps, for him to go away, so that
she might call her mother.  She made no effort to run
from him.  Something in her appearance made him
think that she was ill.  The carriage of her head
seemed queer.  Her coat had a look of staring.  He
wished then, that he had brought his glasses, so that he
might examine her narrowly.  Moving round a little,
he made sure that her coat was in poor condition.  He
judged that she might have been mauled by a beast of
prey.
</p>

<p>
He was just about to move on when a thought
occurred to him.  What if the young of the wild game
should not be immune?  What if the bite of the
infected tsetse should set up a mild form of nagana in
them from which they recover?  What if that mild
sickness should confer a subsequent immunity on the
inflicted individual?  Surely the result would be obvious.
"Vaccination" with the blood of the afflicted calf or
fawn would set up a mild attack of the disease in man,
and, perhaps, give him subsequent immunity from
more virulent infection.  The ailments of wild animals
are few.  What if this fawn should be suffering from
a mild attack of the disease?  He crept a little nearer
to her, bending low down to see if he could see the
swellings on the legs and belly which mark the disease
in quadrupeds.  He could not be sure of them.  He
could only be sure that the coat was staring, and that
the nose and eyes were watery.  He whistled gently to
the little creature, hoping that she would be too young
to be frightened of him.  She stared at him with wide
eyes, trembling slightly, flexing her ears.  He whistled
to her again.  She called plaintively to her dam.  She
lowered her little head, ready to attack, pawing the
ground like a warrior.  Roger fired.  Afterwards he
felt as though he had killed a girl.
</p>

<p>
He returned to "Portobe" weighted down with jars,
which he emptied carefully into sterilised pans.  The
result made "Portobe" look like a cannibal's dairy.
An examination of the blood shewed that both animals
had harboured trypanosomes in large numbers.  When
the blood had coagulated, he decanted the serum into
sterilised bottles, to which he added minute quantities
of antiseptic.  That operation gave him his serum.
He had now to test it for bacteria and for toxins.  He
added a portion from each bottle to various culture-mediums
in test-tubes.  He added these test portions to
all his media, to glycerine-agar and glucose as well
as to those better suited to the growth of trypanosomes.
</p>

<p>
He set them aside to incubate.
</p>

<p>
If there were bacteria in the sera they would increase
and multiply on the delightful food of the media.
When Roger came to examine the media, he came
expecting to find them swarming with bacteria of all
known kinds.  He was naturally vain of the success of
his hunting; but he knew that crude surgery out in the
open is not so wholesome a method of obtaining serum
as might be.  Still, a close examination shewed him
that the cultures had not developed bacteria.  He was
pleased at this; but his pleasure was dashed by the
thought that it was rather too good to be true.  He
might have muddled the experiment by adding too
much disinfectant to the sera while bottling, by using
cultures which had in some way lost their attractiveness,
or by some failure in the preparation of the slides.
After going through his examination the second time,
he decided to proceed.  He injected large doses of the
sera into two monkeys.
</p>

<p>
Again he was successful.  The monkeys shewed no
symptoms of poisoning.  The sera, whatever they might
be, were evidently harmless to the "homologous"
animal.  But the success made Roger even more doubtful
of himself.  It made him actually anxious, lest in
adding disinfectant to the sera, he should have destroyed
the protective forces in them, as well as the micro-organisms
at which he had aimed.  He delayed no longer.
He injected Lionel with a large dose of the serum from
the grown animal; he injected himself with the serum
from the fawn.  Going down to the village, he made a
minute examination of those who were the least ill.
Choosing out those who shewed no outward signs of the
congenital or acquired forms of blood-poisoning, he
injected them with sera, thinking that if they recovered
he would use their sera for other cases.  For his own
part, he felt better already.  The excitement of hope
was on him.  He had risen above his body.
</p>

<p>
For the next few days his life was a fever of hope,
broken with hours of despair.  One of his patients died
suddenly the day after the injection.  Lionel seemed no
better.  Another patient seemed markedly worse.  He
repeated the doses, and passed a miserable morning
watching Lionel.  The evening temperature shewed a
marked decrease.  An examination of the throat glands
shewed that the trypanosomes had become less waggish.
They were bunching into clumps, "agglutinising," with
slow, irregular movements.  That seemed to him to be
the first hopeful sign.  On studying his books he could
not be sure that it really was a good sign.  One book
seemed to say that agglutination made the germs more
virulent; another that it paralysed them.  He could
see for himself that they had ceased to multiply by
splitting longitudinally.  And from that he argued that
their vitality had been weakened.
</p>

<p>
The next day Lionel was better; but the native
patients were all worse.  They were alarmingly worse.
They shewed symptoms which were not in the books.
They swelled slightly, as though the skin had been
inflated.  The flesh seemed bladdery and inelastic at the
same time.  The pigment of the skin became paler; the
patients became an ashy grey colour.  The blood of one
of these sufferers killed a guinea-pig in three hours.
After a short period of evident suffering they died, one
after the other, apparently of the exhaustion following
on high fever.  Roger, in a dreadful state of mental
anguish, stayed with them till they were dead, trying
remedy after remedy.  He felt that he had killed them
all.  He felt that their blood was on his hands.  He
felt that all those people might still have been alive had
he not tried his wretched nostrum on them.  There was
no doubt that the sera had caused their deaths.  Those
who had had no serum injections were no worse than
they had been.  He wondered how long it would be
before these symptoms of swelling and high fever
appeared in himself and Lionel.  He went back to
"Portobe" expecting to find Lionel in high fever, going the
road to Marumba.
</p>

<p>
He found Lionel weakly walking about outside the
tent, conscious, but not yet able to talk intelligibly.
He had not expected to see Lionel walk again.  The
sight made him forget the deaths down in the village.
He shouted with joy.  Closer examination made him
less joyous.  The skin of Lionel's arm, very dull and
inelastic to the touch, was slightly swollen with
something of the bladdery look which he had noticed in the
men now dead.  It was as though the body had been
encased in a bladdery substance slightly inflated.  He
had no heart to test the symptoms upon the body of
another animal.  There was death enough about without
that.  He sat down over the microscope and examined
his sera again and again.  He could find no trace of
any living micro-organisms.  The sera seemed to be
sterile.  But he saw now that it had some evil effect
upon those infected with trypanosomes.  He could not
guess the exact chemical nature of the effect.  It
probably affected the constituents of the blood in some way.
The poison in the sera seemed to need the presence of
trypanosomes to complete its virulence.
</p>

<p>
While he worked over the microscope, he noticed that
his own flesh was developing the symptom.  He put
aside his work when he saw that.  He concluded that
Lionel and he were marked for death within twenty-four
hours.  Before death (as he had learned in the
village) they might look to suffer much pain.  After
some hours of suffering they would become unconscious
and delirious.  After raving for a while they would
die there in the lonely hut, and presently the ants would
march in in regular ranks to give them cleanly burial.
Their bones would lie on the cots till some
thunderstorm swept them under mud.  Nobody would ever
hear of them.  They would be forgotten.  People in
England would wonder what had become of them; they
would wonder less as time went on, and at last they
would cease to wonder.  Newspapers would allude to
him from time to time in paragraphs two lines long.
Then, as his contemporaries grew older, that would stop,
too.  He would be forgotten, utterly, and nobody would
know, and nobody would care.
</p>

<p>
It was dreadful to him to think that nobody would
know.  He could count on an hour or two of freedom
from pain.  Before the pain shut out the world from
him, he would try to leave some record of what they
were.  He sat down to write a death-letter.  It was
useless, of course, and yet it might, perhaps, by a rare
chance, some day, come to the knowledge of those whom
he had known in England.  He wondered who would
find the letter, if it were ever found.  Some great
German scientist about to banish the disease.  Some
drunken English gold prospector with a cockney accent.
Some missionary, or sportsman, or commercial traveller.
More likely it would be some roving savage with a
snuff-box in his earlobe, and a stone of copper wire
about his limbs.  He wrote out a short letter:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Lionel Uppingham Huntley Heseltine, Roger
Monkhouse Naldrett.  Dying here of blood poisoning,
following the use of koodoo serum for trypanosomiasis.
Should this come to the hands of a European, he is
requested to communicate with Dr. Heseltine, 47A
Harley Square, Wimpole Street, W., London, England, and
with the British Consul at Shirikanga, C. F. S."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He added a few words more; but afterwards erased
them.  He had given the essentials.  There was no
need to say more.  He translated the brief message
into French, Spanish, and German, and signed the
copies.  He placed the document in a tin soap box
which he chained to an iron rod driven into the floor of
the hut.  When that was done, he felt that he had taken
his farewell to life.
</p>

<p>
He thought of Ottalie, without hope of any kind.
He was daunted by the thought of her.  He could not
feel that his soul would ever reach to her soul, across
all those wilds.  He was heavy with the growing of the
change upon him.  This death of which he had thought
so grandly seemed very stupid now that he was coming
to know it.  He remembered reproving a young poet
for the remark that death could not possibly be so
stupid as life.  It was monstrous to suppose that the
young poet could be right after all.  And yet&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
He went out hurriedly and released all the laboratory
animals: guinea-pigs, monkeys, and white rats.  They
should not die of starvation, poor beasts.  They
squeaked and gibbered excitedly for a minute or two,
as they moved off to explore.  Probably the snakes had
them all within the week.
</p>

<p>
After some hours of waiting for the agony to begin,
Roger fell asleep, and slept till the next morning.
When he woke he sat up and looked about him, being
not quite sure at first that he was still alive.  His pulse
was normal, his tongue was normal, his heart was
normal.  He felt particularly well.  He looked at his
flesh.  The bladdery look had relapsed, the skin was
normal again.  Looking over to Lionel's cot, he saw
that Lionel was not in the hut.  Fearing that he had
wandered out to die in a fit of delirium, he went out
into the open to look for him.
</p>

<p>
It was a bright, windy, tropic morning, with a tonic
briskness in the air such as one feels sometimes in
England, in April and late September.  One of the
released monkeys was fast by the neck again upon his
perch.  He was munching a biscuit with his entire
vitality.  Lionel sat upon the wall, sunning himself in
a blanket.  His attitude suggested both great physical
weakness, and entire self-confidence.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Roger," he began.  "It's too bad.  You are
a juggins!  You've let all our menagerie go.  What
are we to do for laboratory animals?  I caught
McGinty here.  Otherwise we'd have been without a
single one.  Every cage in the place is wide open.
What have you been doing?"
</p>

<p>
"My God!" said Roger.  "He's cured!"
</p>

<p>
"Cured, sir?" said Lionel.  "Why shouldn't I be?
There's been nothing wrong with me except fever.  But
I'm not joking.  I want to know about these animals.
What were you thinking of to let them out?"
</p>

<p>
"Lionel," said Roger, "for the last five weeks you've
been dying of sleeping sickness.  The atoxyl was lost.
I believe you threw it away."
</p>

<p>
"There's the atoxyl," said Lionel, pointing.  "In
the hole in the wall there.  I put it there yesterday,
after dosing those two."
</p>

<p>
Sure enough, there stood the bottle in the dimness
of a hole in the wall.  Roger must have passed it some
fifty times.
</p>

<p>
"I looked for it everywhere," said Roger.
</p>

<p>
Lionel's eyes narrowed to the sharpness of medical
scrutiny.  He examined Roger for some time.
</p>

<p>
"Let me take your pulse, Lionel," said Roger, staring
back.
</p>

<p>
"My pulse is all right," said Lionel.  "Be off and
look for guinea-pigs."  The pulse was all right; so was
the flesh of the wrist.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose the next thing you'll want me to believe
is that I've still got sleeping sickness?  Well, look at
my tongue.  Perhaps that will convince you."  Lionel
waited for an answer for a moment with protruding
tongue.  The tongue was steady.  Lionel returned to
the charge.  "What have you been playing at with
those Weissner serum pans?" he asked.  "Have you
been bleeding the monkeys?  You seem to have been
having a field-day generally."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you," said Roger, "that you've been dying of
sleeping sickness for five weeks.  Look at your
temperature chart.  Look at my diary.  After the atoxyl
was lost, I tried every mortal thing we had.  And
nothing was any good.  You were drowsing away to death
for days.  Don't you remember?"
</p>

<p>
"I remember having fever, and you or somebody
messing around with a needle.  But, five weeks, man!
Five weeks.  Come!"
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, you have.  You've been unconscious
half the time."
</p>

<p>
"Well.  If I've had sleeping sickness, how comes it
that I'm here, talking to you?  You say yourself the
atoxyl was lost."
</p>

<p>
"Lionel," said Roger, "I injected you with a dead
culture.  After that, I shot a couple of koodoos (if they
were koodoos), a cow and a fawn.  The fawn had
nagana or something.  I took sera from them, and
injected the sera into both of us.  Great big doses in both
cases.  I injected the sera into seven poor devils in the
village, and they all swelled up and died.  It was
awful, Lionel.  What makes people swell up?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Lionel.  "I suppose it might
be anthrax.  Was there fever?"
</p>

<p>
"Intense pain, very high fever, and death apparently
from exhaustion.  And you and I swelled up a little;
and I made sure yesterday that we were both going to
die too.  I wrote letters, and stuck them up on a bar
inside there."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, so that was what the rod was for?  I thought
it was something funny.  And now we are both
cured?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  My God, Lionel, I'm thankful to hear your
voice again.  You don't know what it's been."
</p>

<p>
They shook hands.
</p>

<p>
"You're a public benefactor," said Lionel.  He
looked hard at Roger.  "I give you best," he added.
"I thought you were a griff.  But you've found a cure,
it seems.  Eh?  Look at him.  It's the first time he's
realised it!"
</p>

<p>
"But," Roger stammered, "I've killed seven with
it; that's not what I call a cure."
</p>

<p>
"Did you inject the seven with the dead culture
first?" Lionel asked.
</p>

<p>
"No.  Only myself and you."
</p>

<p>
"There you are," said Lionel.  "You griffs make
the discoveries, and haven't got the gumption to see
them.  My good Lord!  It's as plain as measles.
You inject the dead culture.  That's the first step.
That makes the trypanosomes agglutinise.  Very well,
then.  You inject your serum when they are agglutinised;
not before.  When they are agglutinised, the
serum destroys them, after raising queer symptoms.
When they are not agglutinised the serum destroys you
by the excess of what causes the queer symptoms.  I
don't understand those symptoms.  They are so
entirely unexpected.  Did you examine the blood?"
</p>

<p>
"One cubic centimetre of the venous blood killed a
guinea-pig in three hours."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, no doubt.  But did you look at the blood
microscopically?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Roger, ashamed.  "I looked at my sera
for streptococci."
</p>

<p>
"You juggins!" said Lionel.  "Yet you come out
and land on a cure.  Well, well!  You're a lucky dog.
Let's go in and look at our glands."  Roger noticed
that he walked with the totter of one newly risen from a
violent attack of fever.
</p>

<p>
Four months later, the two men reached Shirikanga
in a canoe of their own making.  They were paddled
by four survivors from the village.  All the rest were
dead, either of sleeping sickness or of the serum.
Lionel had not discovered what it was in the serum
which caused the fatal symptoms.  It contained some
quality which caused the streptococci, or pus-forming
microbes, to increase; but, as far as he could discover,
this quality was exerted only when the patient's blood
contained virulent trypanosomes, or some other active
toxin-producing micro-organisms in the unagglutinised
condition.  They cured four of the villagers.  They
might have saved more had they been able to begin the
treatment earlier in the disease.  They were not
dissatisfied with their success.  They "had powler't up
and down a bit," like the Jovial Huntsmen.  They had
come to some knowledge of each other, and to some
extension of their faculties.
</p>

<p>
Scientifically, they had done less than they had
hoped; but more than they had expected to do.  They
had been the first to cure cases with animal serum.
They had been the first to study in any way the effect
of nagana upon the young of wild game, and to prepare
(as yet untested) vaccine from young antelopes,
quaggas, and elands.  They had discovered a wash of Paris
green and lime which destroyed the tsetse pupas.  They
had cleared some three miles of fly belt.  They had
studied the tsetse.  They had surveyed the whole and
excavated a part of the Zimbabwe.  Lastly, they had
settled the foundations of friendship between them.
</p>

<p>
That was, perhaps, the best result of the expedition.
They had settled a friendship likely to last through life.
They were confident that they would do great things
together.  Shirikanga hove in sight at the river mouth.
Two country barques lay at anchor there, with grimy
awnings over their poops.  Ashore, in the blaze of the
day, were a few white-washed huts, from one of which
a Union Jack floated.  In the compound of another
hut a negro was slowly hoisting the ball of a flag.  He
brought it to the truck and broke it out, so that it
fluttered free.  It was a red burgee, the letter B of the
code.
</p>

<p>
"Mail day," said Lionel.  "We shall be out of here
to-night.  We shall be at Banana by Wednesday.  That
means Antwerp by Wednesday three weeks.  London's
not far away."
</p>

<p>
"Good," said Roger.  He was not thinking of London.
He was thinking of a lonely Irish hill, where
there were many yellow-hammers.  The trees there
stood up like ghosts.  Round an old, grey, two-storied
house the bees murmured.  He was thinking that
perhaps one or two roses might be in blossom about the
house even a month later, when he would stand there.
</p>

<p>
He thought of his life in Africa, and of its bearing
upon himself.  It had done him good.  He was worth
more to the world than he had been a year before.  He
thought little of his success.  It had been fortunate.
It had saved Lionel.  When he thought of his earlier
life he sighed.  He knew that he would have achieved
more than that sorry triumph had he been trained.
His life had been improvised, never organised.  Great
things are done only when the improvising mind has a
great organisation behind it.
</p>

<p>
He thought it all over again when he lay in his bunk
in a cabin of the <i>Kabinda</i>, on his way up-coast.  He
was at peace with the world.  Clean sheets, the European
faces, and the civilised meals in the saloon, had
wiped out the memory of the past.  Africa was already
very dim to him.  The Zimbabwe rose up in his mind
like something seen in a dream, a dim, but rather grand
shape.  The miseries of the camp were dim.  He had
been sad that morning in bidding farewell to the four
whose lives he had saved.  Jellybags, Toro, Buckshot,
and Pocahontas.  He repeated their names and
considered their engaging traits.  Jellybags was the best
of them.  He had liked Jellybags.  Jellybags had
wanted to come with them.  He would never see Jellybags
again.  He didn't care particularly.  The sheets
of the bunk were very comfortable.  At the end of a
great adventure things are seen in false proportions.
Only the thought that those men had shared his life for
a while gave him the suggestion of a qualm before he
put them from his mind.
</p>

<p>
He thought of Ottalie.  He saw her more clearly
than of old.  In the old days he had seen her through
the pink mists of amatory sentiment.  The sentiment
was gone.  Action had knocked it out of him.  He
saw her now as she was.  She was more wonderful in
the clearer light; more wonderful than ever; a fine,
trained, scrupulous mind, drilled to a beautiful
unerring choice in life.  She was near and real to him, so
real that he seemed to be within her mind, following its
fearlessness.  He felt that he understood her now.
With a rush of emotion he felt that he could bring what
she had been into the life of his time.
</p>

<p>
In the steamer at Banana was a German scientist
bound to Sierra Leone.  He spoke English.  He asked
the two friends about their achievement.  Lionel told
him that they had discovered a serum for the cure of
trypanosomiasis.  The German smiled.  "Ah," he
said.  "There is already sera.  The Japanese
bacteriologist, what was his name?  Shima?  Oshima?
Shiga?  No, Hiroshiga.  He have found a good serum,
which makes der peoples die sometimes.  Then there is
Mühlbauer who have improved the serum of Hiroshiga.
He have added a little trypanroth or a little mercury or
somedings.  Now he have cured everymans.  I wonder
you have not seen of Hiroshiga in der newspapers.  He
have make his experiments in der spring; and Mühlbauer
he is now at Nairobi curing everymans.  He
have vaccination camps."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Lionel.  "We've been beaten on the
post.  You hear, Roger?  All that we have done has
been done."
</p>

<p>
"You wait," said Roger.  "We're only beginning."
</p>

<p>
Afterwards he was sad that it was ending thus.  He
would have been proud to have given a cure to the world.
It would have been an offering to Ottalie.  She would
have loved to share that honour.  He had plucked that
poor little flower for her at the risk of his life.  It was
hard to find that it was only a paper flower after all.
He thought of Ottalie as standing at the window of the
upper passage looking out for him.  She seemed to him
to be something of all cleanness and fearlessness,
waiting for him to lead her into the world, so that men
might serve her.
</p>

<p>
In Ottalie's old home, a month later, he saw his way.
Leslie, Lionel, and himself sat together in the twilight,
talking of her.  Roger was deeply moved by a sense of
her presence there.  He leaned forward to them and
spoke earnestly, asking them to join hands in building
some memorial to her.  "She was like a new spirit
coming to the world," he said.  "Like the new spirit.
We ought to bring that new spirit into the world.  Let
us form a brotherhood of three to do that.  We are
three untrained enthusiasts.  Let us prepare an
organisation for the enthusiasts who come after us.  Let us
build up an interest in the new hygiene and the new
science; in all that is cleanly and fearless.  We could
start a little school and laboratory together, and run a
monthly paper preaching our tenets.  All the ills of
modern life come from dirt and sentiment, and the
cowardice which both imply.  If we stand together and
attack those ills, year in and year out, we shall get rid
of them.  Little by little, if one stands at a street
corner, the crowd gathers."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Leslie.  "And you think dirt and
sentiment the bad things?  Well, perhaps you're right.
They're both due to a want of order in the mind.
What do you think, Lionel?"
</p>

<p>
"I?" said Lionel.  "I say, certainly.  We three
are living in a most wonderful time.  The world is just
coming to see that science is not a substitute for
religion, but religion of a very deep and austere kind.
We are seeing only the beginning of it."
</p>

<p>
They settled a plan of action together.
</p>

<p>
Roger went out into the garden, and down the hill,
thinking of the crusade against the weariness and filth
of cities.  There was an afterglow upon the hills.  It
fell with a ruddy glare on the window of his dream.
It thrilled him.  The light would fall there long after
the house had fallen.  It had lighted Ottalie.  It had
burned upon the pane when Ottalie's mother stood
there.  Nature was enduring; Nature the imperfect;
Nature the enemy, which blighted the rose and spread
the weed.  Thinking of the woman who had waited
for him there in his vision, he prayed that her influence
in him might help to bring to earth that promised life,
in which man, curbing Nature to his use, would assert a
new law and rule like a king, where now, even in his
strength, he walks sentenced, a prey to all things
baser.

Captain Margaret
</p>

<p class="t3">
BY JOHN MASEFIELD
</p>

<p class="t4">
<i>Cloth, 12mo, $1.35</i>
</p>

<p>
Captain Margaret, owner of the "Broken Heart," mild dreamer
and hardy adventurer in one, is a type of character one does not
often meet in fiction, and his troubled pursuit of the vision he
is always seeing, in Mr. Masefield's telling, is a story such as we
seldom hear.  It is a strange crew that goes scurrying out of
Salcombe Pool on a darkening flood-tide in the "Broken Heart,"
bound for the treasure-land of Darien.  There is Captain
Cammock, strong and fine, Stukeley the beast, Perrin the feeble,
Olivia beautiful and blind, and Captain Margaret wisely good and
uncomplaining&mdash;not a one of them but shines out from the
story with unforgettable vividness.  From England to Virginia
and the Spanish Main with men at arms between decks goes the
"Broken Heart" following her master's dream, and her thrilling
voyage with its storms and battles is strongly and stirringly told.
When John Masefield writes of the sea, the sea lives.
</p>

<p>
"A romantic novel, a capital tale of adventure, a yarn of the
sea with plenty of color and mystery, a story that has all the
conventional characters of romance&mdash;a beautiful heroine, a brave
hero, a villain, picturesque seamen and odd characters in good
measure."&mdash;<i>Review of Reviews</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Margaret is a novel which gives not only a splendid
picture of the buccaneering times of the late seventeenth century,
but one which for beauty of language, skill in character drawing,
straightforward march of story and virility in tone, deserves a
wide audience."&mdash;<i>The Bookman</i>.
</p>

<p>
"The author shows his intense love and understanding of the
sea and of the ships that sail upon her, keen power of
characterization and the ability to spin a thoroughly
interesting story."&mdash;<i>Providence Journal</i>.

The title piece in this new volume is a dramatic poem
of sixty pages, the action of which takes place in the time
of Christ.  The characters introduced include Pontius
Pilate, Joseph of Ramah and Herod.  The play, for it is
really such, is written in rhyme and is one of Mr. Masefield's
most interesting and important contributions to
literature.  In addition to this there are in the book many
sonnets and shorter poems embodying the very finest
work Mr. Masefield has yet done.

</p>

<p>
This is a revised edition of what is perhaps Mr. Zangwill's
most popular play.  Numerous changes have been made in the
text, which has been considerably lengthened thereby.  The
appeal of the drama to the readers of this country is particularly
strong, in that it deals with that great social process by which all
nationalities are blended together for the making of the real
American.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
